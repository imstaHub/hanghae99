      "1. **Fouling Issues**: Fouling is caused by precipitates, colloidal particles, bacteria, biofilm, and dissolved organic matter, leading to reduced permeate production and shorter membrane lifespan.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Membrane Lifespan**: SWRO membranes typically last 5-6 years, but fouling can significantly affect their longevity.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Energy Consumption**: The specific energy consumption (SEC) for the SWRO process ranges from 2.3 to 3.0 kWh/m³, which is much higher than the theoretical energy requirement of 0.7 kWh/m³ for 100% recovery and 1.1 kWh/m³ for 50% recovery.\n",

      "6. **Energy Consumption Improvement**: On average, SEC improves by 0.07 kWh/m³ after CIP.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Optimal Replacement Period**: Replacing membranes every 4 years results in the lowest energy consumption and cumulative costs over a 12-year period. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the study suggests that regular membrane replacement is more cost-effective than relying solely on CIP in the long term.\n",
      "The document discusses the energy consumption associated with water treatment processes, specifically focusing on the specific energy consumption (SEC) of membrane-based systems. Key points include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Energy Requirements**: The thermodynamic energy requirement for water recovery is 0.7 kWh/m³ for 100% recovery and 1.1 kWh/m³ for 50% recovery. A baseline test showed an SEC of 1.58 kWh/m³ at 42% recovery, which is higher than the theoretical values.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Current SEC Levels**: An internal audit at MWSC’s Hulhumalé site found SEC values ranging from 2.12 kWh/m³ to 2.92 kWh/m³, indicating higher energy consumption than ideal.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Impact of Membrane Fouling**: Membrane fouling significantly increases SEC by causing blockages that degrade performance, leading to higher energy demands and operating costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cleaning Methods**: Various cleaning methods are employed to address fouling:\n",
      "   - Low pH cleaners (e.g., citric acid) target scale minerals and inorganic materials.\n",
      "   - High pH cleaners address organic fouling and biofouling.\n",
      "   - Stronger chemicals like hydrochloric acid may be used for severe scaling, but they risk damaging membranes.\n",
      "   - Biocides are used to prevent bacterial growth.\n",
      "   - Mechanical methods, such as reverse flow cleaning, effectively remove biological fouling and particulates.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Effective Cleaning Agents**: High pH cleaners, such as combinations of sodium tripolyphosphate and EDTA or sodium hydroxide and sodium dodecyl sulfate, are. This instance will be ignored in loss calculation. Note, if this happens often, consider increasing the `max_seq_length`.\n",
