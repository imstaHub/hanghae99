All these experimen-tal results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We ﬁrst observe the inﬂuence of the non-linear activations func-tions. We ﬁnd that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random ini-tialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into satu-ration. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We ﬁnd that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneﬁcial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during train-ing, with the idea that training may be more dif-ﬁcult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new ini-tialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence. 1 Deep Neural Networks Deep learning methods aim at learning feature hierarchies with features from higher levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level features.

Much attention has re-cently been devoted to them (see (Bengio, 2009) for a re-view), because of their theoretical appeal, inspiration from biology and human cognition, and because of empirical success in vision (Ranzato et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008) and natural language process-ing (NLP) (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Mnih & Hinton, 2009). Theoretical results reviewed and discussed by Ben-gio (2009), suggest that in order to learn the kind of com-plicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Most of the recent experimental results with deep archi-tecture are obtained with models that can be turned into deep supervised neural networks, but with initialization or training schemes different from the classical feedforward neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986).

But earlier work (Bengio et al., 2007) had shown that even a purely supervised but greedy layer-wise proce-dure would give better results. So here instead of focus-ing on what unsupervised pre-training or semi-supervised criteria bring to deep architectures, we focus on analyzing what may be going wrong with good old (but deep) multi-layer neural networks. Our analysis is driven by investigative experiments to mon-itor activations (watching for saturation of hidden units) and gradients, across layers and across training iterations. We also evaluate the effects on these of choices of acti-vation function (with the idea that it might affect satura-tion) and initialization procedure (since unsupervised pre-training is a particular form of initialization and it has a drastic impact).          250 Understanding the difﬁculty of training deep feedforward neural networks 2 Experimental Setting and Datasets Code to produce the new datasets introduced in this section is available from: http://www.iro.umontreal. ca/˜lisa/twiki/bin/view.cgi/Public/ DeepGradientsAISTATS2010. 2.1 Online Learning on an Inﬁnite Dataset: Shapeset-3 ×2 Recent work with deep architectures (see Figure 7 in Ben-gio (2009)) shows that even with very large training sets or online learning, initialization from unsupervised pre-training yields substantial improvement, which does not vanish as the number of training examples increases. The online setting is also interesting because it focuses on the optimization issues rather than on the small-sample regu-larization effects, so we decided to include in our experi-ments a synthetic images dataset inspired from Larochelle et al. (2007) and Larochelle et al. (2009), from which as many examples as needed could be sampled, for testing the online learning scenario. We call this dataset the Shapeset-3 ×2 dataset, with ex-ample images in Figure 1 (top). Shapeset-3 ×2 con-tains images of 1 or 2 two-dimensional objects, each taken from 3 shape categories (triangle, parallelogram, ellipse), and placed with random shape parameters (relative lengths and/or angles), scaling, rotation, translation and grey-scale. We noticed that for only one shape present in the image the task of recognizing it was too easy. We therefore decided to sample also images with two objects, with the constraint that the second object does not overlap with the ﬁrst by more than ﬁfty percent of its area, to avoid hiding it en-tirely. The task is to predict the objects present (e.g. trian-gle + ellipse, parallelogram + parallelogram, triangle alone, etc.) without having to distinguish between the foreground shape and the background shape when they overlap. This therefore deﬁnes nine conﬁguration classes.\n\nPlease summarize the main points of the content.\nAnswer:",

Here are the main points:\n\n1. **Weight Initialization**: The standard initialization method leads to a variance in weights that decreases as it propagates through layers. This can negatively affect the training of deep networks.\n\n2. **Normalized Initialization**: The authors propose a new initialization method, termed \"normalized initialization,\" which aims to maintain consistent activation variances and back-propagated gradient variances across layers. This method uses a uniform distribution based on the sizes of the layers.\n\n3. **Empirical Validation**: The authors conducted experiments to validate their theoretical claims, analyzing histograms of activation values and gradients using both standard and normalized initialization methods. They observed that the normalized initialization maintains a more stable ratio of singular values in the Jacobian matrix compared to standard initialization.\n\n4. **Gradient Dynamics**: The document highlights the complexity of learning dynamics in deep networks. Initially, with standard initialization, the variance of back-propagated gradients decreases as they move down the layers, but this trend reverses during training. In contrast, normalized initialization does not exhibit this decreasing trend.\n\n5. **Weight Gradient Behavior**: Despite the decreasing back-propagated gradients with standard initialization, the variance of weight gradients remains relatively constant across layers. However, as training progresses, the gradients diverge, with lower layers exhibiting larger gradients.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes the importance of weight initialization in deep networks and presents evidence that normalized initialization can lead to better gradient propagation and training dynamics."

The learning rate ϵ is a hyper-parameter that is optimized based on validation set error after a large number of updates (5 million). We varied the type of non-linear activation function in the hidden layers: the sigmoid 1/(1 + e−x), the hyperbolic tangent tanh(x), and a newly proposed activation func-tion (Bergstra et al., 2009) called the softsign, x/(1 +|x|). The softsign is similar to the hyperbolic tangent (its range is -1 to 1) but its tails are quadratic polynomials rather than exponentials, i.e., it approaches its asymptotes much slower. In the comparisons, we search for the best hyper-parameters (learning rate and depth) separately for each model. Note that the best depth was always ﬁve for Shapeset-3 ×2, except for the sigmoid, for which it was four. We initialized the biases to be 0 and the weights Wij at each layer with the following commonly used heuristic: Wij ∼U [ − 1√n, 1√n ] , (1) where U[−a, a] is the uniform distribution in the interval (−a, a) and n is the size of the previous layer (the number of columns of W ). 3 Effect of Activation Functions and Saturation During Training Two things we want to avoid and that can be revealed from the evolution of activations is excessive saturation of acti-vation functions on one hand (then gradients will not prop-agate well), and overly linear units (they will not compute something interesting). 3.1 Experiments with the Sigmoid The sigmoid non-linearity has been already shown to slow down learning because of its none-zero mean that induces important singular values in the Hessian (LeCun et al., 1998b). In this section we will see another symptomatic behavior due to this activation function in deep feedforward networks. We want to study possible saturation, by looking at the evo-lution of activations during training, and the ﬁgures in this section show results on the Shapeset-3 ×2 data, but sim-ilar behavior is observed with the other datasets.

Figure 2: Mean and standard deviation (vertical bars) of the activation values (output of the sigmoid) during supervised learning, for the different hidden layers of a deep archi-tecture. The top hidden layer quickly saturates at 0 (slow-ing down all learning), but then slowly desaturates around epoch 100. We see that very quickly at the beginning, all the sigmoid activation values of the last hidden layer are pushed to their lower saturation value of 0. Inversely, the others layers have a mean activation value that is above 0.5, and decreas-ing as we go from the output layer to the input layer. We have found that this kind of saturation can last very long in deeper networks with sigmoid activations, e.g., the depth-ﬁve model never escaped this regime during training. The big surprise is that for intermediate number of hidden lay-ers (here four), the saturation regime may be escaped. At the same time that the top hidden layer moves out of satura-tion, the ﬁrst hidden layer begins to saturate and therefore to stabilize. We hypothesize that this behavior is due to the combina-tion of random initialization and the fact that an hidden unit output of 0 corresponds to a saturated sigmoid. Note that deep networks with sigmoids but initialized from unsuper-vised pre-training (e.g. from RBMs) do not suffer from this saturation behavior. Our proposed explanation rests on the hypothesis that the transformation that the lower layers of the randomly initialized network computes initially is not useful to the classiﬁcation task, unlike the transforma-tion obtained from unsupervised pre-training. The logistic layer output softmax(b+W h) might initially rely more on its biases b (which are learned very quickly) than on the top hidden activations h derived from the input image (because h would vary in ways that are not predictive of y, maybe correlated mostly with other and possibly more dominant variations of x). Thus the error gradient would tend to push W h towards 0, which can be achieved by pushing h towards 0. In the case of symmetric activation functions like the hyperbolic tangent and the softsign, sitting around 0 is good because it allows gradients to ﬂow backwards. However, pushing the sigmoid outputs to 0 would bring them into a saturation regime which would prevent gradi-ents to ﬂow backward and prevent the lower layers from learning useful features. Eventually but slowly, the lower layers move toward more useful features and the top hidden layer then moves out of the saturation regime.

However, with our standard weight initialization U [ − 1√n , 1√n ] , we observe a sequentially oc-curring saturation phenomenon starting with layer 1 and propagating up in the network, as illustrated in Figure 3. Why this is happening remains to be understood.

We see the ﬁrst hidden layer satu-rating ﬁrst, then the second, etc. Bottom: 98 percentiles (markers alone) and standard deviation (solid lines with markers) of the distribution of activation values for the soft-sign during learning. Here the different layers saturate less and do so together. 3.3 Experiments with the Softsign The softsign x/(1+ |x|) is similar to the hyperbolic tangent but might behave differently in terms of saturation because of its smoother asymptotes (polynomial instead of expo-nential). We see on Figure 3 that the saturation does not occur one layer after the other like for the hyperbolic tan-gent. It is faster at the beginning and then slow, and all layers move together towards larger weights. We can also see at the end of training that the histogram of activation values is very different from that seen with the hyperbolic tangent (Figure 4). Whereas the latter yields modes of the activations distribution mostly at the extremes (asymptotes -1 and 1) or around 0, the softsign network has modes of activations around its knees (between the linear regime around 0 and the ﬂat regime around -1 and 1). These are the areas where there is substantial non-linearity but where the gradients would ﬂow well.

Bradley (2009) found that back-propagated gradients were smaller as one moves from the output layer towards the input layer, just after initialization. He studied networks with linear activation at each layer, ﬁnding that the variance of the back-propagated gradients decreases as we go back-wards in the network.

The results displayed (Figures 6, 7 and 8) are from exper-iments on Shapeset-3 ×2, but qualitatively similar results were obtained with the other datasets. We monitor the singular values of the Jacobian matrix as-sociated with layer i: Ji = ∂zi+1 ∂zi (17) When consecutive layers have the same dimension, the av-erage singular value corresponds to the average ratio of in-ﬁnitesimal volumes mapped from zi to zi+1, as well as to the ratio of average activation variance going from zi to zi+1. With our normalized initialization, this ratio is around 0.8 whereas with the standard initialization, it drops down to 0.5. Figure 6: Activation values normalized histograms with hyperbolic tangent activation, with standard (top) vs nor-malized initialization (bottom). Top: 0-peak increases for higher layers. 4.3 Back-propagated Gradients During Learning The dynamic of learning in such networks is complex and we would like to develop better tools to analyze and track it. In particular, we cannot use simple variance calculations in our theoretical analysis because the weights values are not anymore independent of the activation values and the linearity hypothesis is also violated. As ﬁrst noted by Bradley (2009), we observe (Figure 7) that at the beginning of training, after the standard initializa-tion (eq. 1), the variance of the back-propagated gradients gets smaller as it is propagated downwards. However we ﬁnd that this trend is reversed very quickly during learning. Using our normalized initialization we do not see such de-creasing back-propagated gradients (bottom of Figure 7). Figure 7: Back-propagated gradients normalized his-tograms with hyperbolic tangent activation, with standard (top) vs normalized (bottom) initialization. Top: 0-peak decreases for higher layers.

However, this is explained by our theoretical analysis above (eq. 14).

This saturation can lead to poorer quality solutions and generalization.\n\n2. **Hyperbolic Tangent Networks**: Unlike sigmoid networks, hyperbolic tangent networks do not suffer from saturation in the top hidden layer due to their symmetry around zero. However, a sequential saturation phenomenon occurs starting from the first layer and propagating upward, which is not yet fully understood.\n\n3. **Softsign Activation Function**: The softsign function, which has smoother asymptotes, shows a different saturation behavior compared to the hyperbolic tangent.

In addition, we ob-served further gains by combining normalized initialization with second order methods: the estimated Hessian might then focus on discrepancies between units, not having to correct important initial discrepancies between layers.

This observation aligns with findings from previous studies.\n\n3. **Linear Regime Analysis**: The document explores the behavior of gradients in the linear regime, where it is assumed that weights are initialized independently and input feature variances are uniform.\n\n4. **Variance of Gradients**: The variance of the gradients is expressed in relation to the input, output, and weight initialization randomness, with specific equations provided to illustrate how these variances propagate through the layers of the network.\n\n5. **Initialization Impact**: The importance of proper weight initialization is emphasized, as it affects the variance of gradients and overall training dynamics.\n\nOverall, the document highlights the significance of choosing appropriate cost functions and understanding gradient behavior for effective neural network training.\nThe document discusses the performance of different neural network architectures and initialization methods during training, particularly focusing on activation functions such as softsign, tanh, and sigmoid. Here are the main points:\n\n1. **Error Curves and Learning Rates**: The learning rate is optimized for each network to minimize validation error. The document notes significant saturation during learning on the Shapeset-3 ×2 dataset, indicating that certain initialization methods and activation functions have more pronounced effects.\n\n2. **Performance of Activation Functions**:\n   - Classical networks using sigmoid or tanh activations perform poorly, converging slowly and often to suboptimal local minima.\n   - Softsign networks demonstrate greater robustness to initialization compared to tanh networks, likely due to their gentler non-linearity.\n   - Normalized initialization is beneficial for tanh networks, helping maintain the magnitude of activations and gradients across layers.\n\n3. **Gradient Variance and Initialization**: The document highlights the importance of monitoring weight gradients and activations during training. Normalized initialization helps maintain consistent variance in weight gradients across layers, improving training dynamics.\n\n4. **Second Order Methods**: The use of second-order methods, such as exploiting the Hessian or gradient variance estimates, can improve performance but do not surpass the results achieved with normalized initialization. Combining normalized initialization with second-order methods can yield further gains.\n\n5. **Layer Size and Configuration**: The study confirms that consistent performance gains are observed regardless of the number of units per layer, whether increasing or decreasing layer size.\n\n6. **General Recommendations**:\n   - Monitoring activations and gradients is crucial for diagnosing training difficulties in deep networks.\n   - Sigmoid activations should be avoided when initializing from small random weights due to poor learning dynamics.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes the significance of activation functions and initialization methods in the training of deep feedforward neural networks, providing insights into improving their performance.\nThe document discusses the challenges and observations related to training deep feedforward neural networks, particularly focusing on the behavior of different activation functions: sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and softsign.\n\n1. **Saturation in Sigmoid Networks**: The lower layers of networks using sigmoid activation functions can experience saturation, which hinders their ability to learn useful features. This saturation can lead to poorer quality solutions and generalization.\n\n2. **Hyperbolic Tangent Networks**: Unlike sigmoid networks, hyperbolic tangent networks do not suffer from saturation in the top hidden layer due to their symmetry around zero. However, a sequential saturation phenomenon occurs starting from the first layer and propagating upward, which is not yet fully understood.\n\n3. **Softsign Activation Function**: The softsign function, which has smoother asymptotes, shows a different saturation behavior compared to the hyperbolic tangent. All layers tend to saturate together rather than sequentially, and the activation values at the end of training are distributed differently, with modes around the non-saturated regions.\n\n4. **Gradient Propagation and Cost Functions**: The document emphasizes the effectiveness of using the logistic regression or conditional log-likelihood cost function with softmax outputs for classification problems, as it leads to better training outcomes compared to the traditional quadratic cost function. This observation highlights the importance of the choice of cost function in mitigating plateaus in training criteria.\n\nOverall, the document explores the dynamics of activation functions and their impact on the training process of deep neural networks, particularly in terms of saturation and gradient propagation.\nThe document discusses the optimization of feedforward neural networks with varying architectures, specifically focusing on the impact of different activation functions during training. Key points include:\n\n1. **Network Architecture**: The study involves feedforward neural networks with one to five hidden layers, each containing one thousand hidden units, and a softmax logistic regression output layer.\n\n2. **Cost Function**: The cost function used is the negative log-likelihood, which measures the performance of the model based on the input image and target class pairs.\n\n3. **Optimization Method**: Stochastic back-propagation is employed for optimization, using mini-batches of size ten. The learning rate is treated as a hyper-parameter, optimized based on validation set error after extensive updates (5 million).\n\n4. **Activation Functions**: Various non-linear activation functions are tested, including sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and a new function called softsign. The softsign function is noted for its slower approach to asymptotes compared to the hyperbolic tangent.\n\n5. **Hyper-parameter Tuning**: The best hyper-parameters, including learning rate and network depth, are determined separately for each model, with the optimal depth generally being five layers, except for the sigmoid function, which performed best with four layers.\n\n6. **Weight Initialization**: Weights are initialized using a uniform distribution based on the size of the previous layer.\n\n7. **Saturation and Learning Issues**: The document highlights the problems associated with the sigmoid activation function, particularly its tendency to cause saturation, which can hinder gradient propagation and slow down learning. The evolution of activation values during training is analyzed to understand these effects.\n\n8. **Experimental Results**: The results, particularly for the sigmoid activation function, are illustrated through graphs showing the mean and standard deviation of activation values across different hidden layers during training.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes the importance of activation functions and their effects on the training dynamics of deep neural networks.\nThe document discusses the behavior of activation values in deep neural networks, particularly focusing on networks using sigmoid activation functions. Key points include:\n\n1. **Activation Saturation**: During training, the top hidden layer of a deep architecture with sigmoid activations quickly saturates at 0, which slows down learning. This saturation can persist in deeper networks, while networks with an intermediate number of hidden layers may escape this saturation.\n\n2. **Layer Dynamics**: As the top hidden layer desaturates around epoch 100, the first hidden layer begins to saturate and stabilize. This behavior is attributed to random initialization and the nature of the transformations computed by the lower layers, which may not be useful for the classification task initially.\n\n3. **Impact of Initialization**: Networks initialized from unsupervised pre-training (e.g., using Restricted Boltzmann Machines) do not exhibit the same saturation issues as randomly initialized networks.\n\n4. **Gradient Flow**: The document explains that pushing sigmoid outputs to 0 can hinder gradient flow, preventing lower layers from learning useful features. In contrast, symmetric activation functions like the hyperbolic tangent allow for better gradient flow, avoiding the saturation problem.\n\n5. **Quality of Solutions**: Even after the top hidden layer moves out of saturation, the network may converge to poorer quality solutions compared to those using symmetric activation functions, affecting generalization.\n\n6. **Experiments with Hyperbolic Tangent**: The document notes that hyperbolic tangent networks do not experience the same saturation issues as sigmoid networks due to their symmetry around 0, although challenges with weight initialization still exist.\n\nOverall, the content highlights the challenges of training deep networks with sigmoid activations and contrasts them with networks using hyperbolic tangent activations.\nThe document discusses the challenges and advancements in training deep feedforward neural networks, particularly focusing on the period after 2006 when significant improvements were made.

Since then, new algorithms have demonstrated the advantages of deeper architectures.\n\n2. **Gradient Descent Limitations**: The authors aim to understand why standard gradient descent from random initialization performs poorly with deep networks, which has led to the development of better training algorithms.\n\n3. **Activation Functions**: The study highlights the impact of non-linear activation functions, particularly criticizing the logistic sigmoid function for causing saturation in deep networks. It notes that while saturated units can eventually recover, this process is slow and can lead to training plateaus.\n\n4. **Alternative Non-linearities**: The authors suggest that using activation functions that saturate less can improve training outcomes.\n\n5. **Layer Dynamics**: The research examines how activations and gradients behave across different layers during training, proposing that difficulties arise when the singular values of the Jacobian for each layer deviate significantly from 1.\n\n6. **New Initialization Scheme**: Based on their findings, the authors propose a new initialization method that significantly enhances convergence speed during training.\n\n7. **Deep Learning Significance**: The document emphasizes the importance of deep learning methods in learning complex feature hierarchies, with applications in various fields such as vision and natural language processing.\n\n8. **Unsupervised Pre-training**: The authors reference recent analyses indicating that unsupervised pre-training can serve as a regularizer, helping to initialize parameters in a more favorable region of the optimization landscape.\n\nOverall, the document aims to provide insights into the training difficulties of deep neural networks and suggests improvements for future algorithms.\n\nPlease write a comprehensive summary of this..\nAnswer: ",

Ltd. ABSTRACT Fouling reduces the performance of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO)  membranes by causing blockage, which leads to increased differential pressure across  the membrane vessels. Over time, this can reduce efficiency and the quality of permeate.  The lifespan of an RO membrane depends on the quality of the feed water, the flux  the membranes are subjected to (which is influenced by the percentage recovery), and  the extent of scaling/fouling the membranes accumulate. Cleaning-in-place (CIP) is a  commonly carried-out practice on RO plants to counteract fouling within the membranes.  This study evaluates the financial impact of membrane fouling by comparing the effect of  membrane replacement and CIP on the specific energy consumption (SEC) of a SWRO  plant operated in the Maldives by using operational data collected between January  2018 and January 2024. The water production and energy consumption of the plant  were used to calculate the SEC. A life cycle cost analysis was carried out to determine  the optimum membrane replacement period. The breakeven point for replacing every 4  years as compared to replacing them in every 5 years is 5 years. The breakeven of 4-year-period membrane replacement against a scenario where only CIP is done is 6.08 years. It  was found that the SEC improves by 0.07 kWh/m³ on average after CIP . Replacing the  membrane every 4 years results in the lowest energy consumption and consequently the  lowest cumulative cost over a 12-year period. Keywords: Seawater reverse osmosis, Experimental, Cleaning-in-place, Specific energy  consumption, Life cycle costs Introduction  Background  The implementation and operation of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membrane  filtration systems are complex, with fouling presenting a significant challenge.  Fouling is caused by the accumulation of precipitates, colloidal particles, bacteria,  biofilm, and dissolved organic matter (Andes et al., 2013; Hydranautics, 2017;  Muñoz et al., 2014).  Typically SWRO membranes such as, Hydranautics SWC5-ISSN 2308-5959/20241130 (c) 2024 The Maldives National University 7 A.A.Najeeb et al. LD, have a life span of  is typically 5-6 years (Hydranautics, 2013). However,  fouling within the SWRO adversely impacts both the permeate production and  membrane longevity. Despite advancements in feed water treatment, complete  prevention of fouling remains unachievable (Alnajjar et al., 2021). To mitigate  performance degradation, chemical and/or mechanical cleaning is employed,  based on the specific type of fouling. However, these cleaning process necessitate  careful implementation to avoid membrane damage, as repeated cycles of fouling  and cleaning can further shorten the membrane lifespan (Muñoz et al., 2014). The  specific energy consumption (SEC) of the SWRO process excluding pre-treatment  and post-treatment in global desalination operates averages between 2.3–3.0  kWh/m³ (Kim et al., 2019; Kishizawa et al., 2015).

The  specific energy consumption (SEC) of the SWRO process excluding pre-treatment  and post-treatment in global desalination operates averages between 2.3–3.0  kWh/m³ (Kim et al., 2019; Kishizawa et al., 2015). SEC serves as an indicator  of the energy required to produce one unit of desalinated water and is currently  significantly higher than the thermodynamic energy requirement of 0.7 kWh/m³  (for 100% theoretical recovery) or the more practical 1.1 kW/m³ for 50% recovery  (Voutchkov, 2018). A baseline test done at a state-of-the-art facility demonstrated  an SEC of 1.58 kWh/m³ at 42% recovery employing a lower flux than MWSC’s  current operational practice (MacHarg et al., 2008). An internal energy audit at  MWSC’s Hulhumalé site revealed that the SEC of its plants ranged between 2.12  kWh/m³ and 2.92 kWh/m³ (Ibrahim & Sadiq, 2022). Membrane fouling significantly impacts the SEC, leading to increased energy  demand (Ruiz-García et al., 2023). Fouling or scaling causes blockages that  degrade membrane performance, thereby raising energy consumption. This, in  turn, increases the operating cost of the plant (Frans Knops et al., 2007; S. Pietsch,  2017).  Low pH cleaners, such as citric acid, are often used to target scale minerals  and inorganic colloidal material, whereas high pH cleaners are applied to address  organic fouling and biofouling (Andes et al., 2013).  In cases of severe scaling,  stronger chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) may be employed. However,  their use carries an increased risk of damaging the polyamide layer of the  membrane. Biocides are also utilized to inhibit the bacterial growth. Mechanical  methods, such as reverse flow cleaning are effective for removing foulants near  the feed side of the membrane. This technique specifically targets biological  fouling, particulates, and colloidal matter (Andes et al., 2013). High pH cleaners  (pH of ~10), such as combinations of sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium salt  of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Hydranautics, 2017), or sodium  hydroxide and sodium dodecyl sulfate, are particularly effective in mitigating  fouling caused by biological matter (Al-Balushi et al., 2024; Hydranautics, 2017).  Cleaning-in-place (CIP) is one of the primary cleaning methods used in the  industry. In this process, the plant is shut down, and a cleaning agent mixed with  permeate water circulates through the pressure vessels for a set amount of time.  CIP equipment is often integrated into the design of the RO plants, through hard  piping, requiring only the operation of valves to initiate the cleaning cycle.    In industrial practice, membranes are discarded when their flow and quality  drops more than 15% of the initial values (Eduardo Coutinho de Paula et al., 2017).  However, membranes can only be discarded if cleaning fails to restore significant  8Evaluation of Effectiveness of Cleaning-in-Place of Membranes and Optimum\n\nPlease summarize the main points of the content.\nAnswer:",

The continued use of blocked membranes can result in increased operational  costs, particularly energy costs, as greater pump power is required to maintain the  desired flow rate (Frans Knops et al., 2007). Fouling is multi-faceted issue that  requires a holistic approach, which is currently lacking in the cleaning practices  of  MWSC. While the impact of fouling on SEC is generally understood, and SEC  is used as a performance indicator of, there is an insufficient consideration of the  cost associated with ineffective cleaning. Membrane replacement is a significant  expense; thus, it is essential to evaluate the costs accumulated by fouling against  those of membrane replacement to draw comparisons in the context of current  practices at MWSC to a more simplified approach to membrane cleaning and  extended operations of plants with fouled membranes. Objective  This study aims to evaluate the energy efficiency associated with CIP and  identify the most cost-effective membrane replacement interval by analyzing data  collected on an SWRO plant at MWSC’s Hulhumalé Operations Site. Membrane  replacement intervals of four years and five years were compared, along with a  breakeven analysis of membrane replacement costs against the cumulative costs  incurred when membranes are not replaced but only subjected to periodic cleaning.  The impact of ineffective cleaning on the membrane lifespan and SEC of the  plant are outlined in terms of energy demand and cumulative costs. Additionally,  recommendations are provided to enhance the SEC and extend membrane lifespan. Methodology Research Design  Data for this study was collected from one of the RO plants at MWSC’s operations  centre. The SWRO plant has a production capacity of 3000 m³/day, and consists  of two units, each containing 18 pressure vessels (36 in total). Each pressure  vessel houses six Hydranautic SWC5-LD spiral-wound composite polyamide  SWRO membranes, resulting in a total of 216 membranes across the plant (with  two units). Hydranautics SWC5-LD has a membrane surface area of 37.2 m²  and is rated for a permeate flow of 34.1 m³/day at 38.2 l/m²h flux. At MWSC  however, the membranes are operated at a lower flux range of 14-16 l/m²h. This  lower flux operation is intentionally maintained to reduce membrane fouling rates  (Cornelissen et al., 2021). It is important to note that the SWRO plant is not a  dedicated experimental setup, but an operational plant used for water production  of Hulhumalé City. The plant was commissioned in late 2017 and fully operational  by January 2018, marking the beginning of data collection for this study. 9 A.A.Najeeb et al. Figure  2.1: Overview of SWRO at MWSC.

The feed water for the SWRO process is drawn up from boreholes 30 – 50  meters deep using submersible pumps and filtered through the primary filter  of 100 μm mesh size, particle filter of 50 μm mesh size, and bag filters of 5 μm  pore size to remove particles that could clog up the membranes. No chemical  pretreatment is currently applied, as water from deep boreholes is naturally well-filtered and contains minimal biological contaminants. The feed water entering the  SWRO membranes has a turbidity of less than 1 NTU.  After filtration, the flow from the bag filter is split into two streams: with 30-35% of the flow being directed into the high-pressure pump while the remainder  is sent into the pressure exchanger (PX) as illustrated in Figure  2.1. In the PX,  the feed stream gets its pressure boosted from the reject stream exiting the SWRO  modules at high pressure. The high-pressure feed stream from the PX gets a  further pressure boost via the booster pump, to equalize both streams (feed from  PX stream and feed from high-pressure stream) to the same pressure. It is at this  high pressure that the feed streams converge and enters the SWRO membranes.  The reject stream exiting the PX at low pressure is directed to the sump well,  while the permeate is transferred through degassifiers into storage tanks. The water  streams are consistently maintained at a temperature between 25° C and 27°C.  Since this temperature variation is minimal, it is unlikely to significantly affect the  processes involved.  The cleaning-in-place (CIP) procedure currently used by the MWSC involves  the following steps (Aqua-Tech, 2009): 1. The pressure pipes are flushed with chlorine-free permeate water 2. A fresh batch of the cleaning solution is prepared in the tank using permeate 3. The cleaning solution is circulated through the plant for approximately five  hours, specific to the plant under study. 10 4. The tank is drained and refilled with permeate water for rinsing. 5. Step 1 is repeated for a few minutes to ensure thorough flushing 6. The plant is operated in bypass mode until permeate flow is clear, free of  foam and without residues (usually about 15-30 minutes). Hydranautics does not recommend cleaning the membranes at extreme pH  and temperature ranges for prolonged periods (Hydranautics, 2017).  While  cleaning at extremes can enhance the effectiveness of the cleaning procedure, it  may adversely impact the membrane lifespan. Therefore, if cleaning at extreme  pH or temperature ranges is necessary, reducing the contact time is recommended  to minimize the potential damage. The recommended pH range for Hydranautics  SWC5-LD membranes varies with temperature; pH 1 to 12 for temperatures  ≤25°C, pH 1 to 12 for temperatures ≤35°C, and pH 2 to 11 for temperatures  ≤45°C (Hydranautics, 2017).

Therefore, if cleaning at extreme  pH or temperature ranges is necessary, reducing the contact time is recommended  to minimize the potential damage. The recommended pH range for Hydranautics  SWC5-LD membranes varies with temperature; pH 1 to 12 for temperatures  ≤25°C, pH 1 to 12 for temperatures ≤35°C, and pH 2 to 11 for temperatures  ≤45°C (Hydranautics, 2017). For continuous operations involving longer contact  times, the acceptable pH range is narrower, between pH 3 to 10.5. Currently MWSC employs only citric acid as a cleaning agent, for general  untargeted cleaning. Citric acid effectively targets scale minerals and inorganic  colloidal materials, and as a weak acid does not compromise membrane integrity  (Andes et al., 2013). At times, caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) is used to adjust  the pH of the cleaning solution.  Feed water currently is not pre-treated with antiscalants before being pumped  into the polyamide membranes and citric acid serves as an effective cleaning  agent to address scaling within the membranes. Biological fouling, however, is not  addressed in the current cleaning regimen, as biofouling has not been identified as  a significant issue on MWSC plants. Data Collection  Water production data were obtained from totalizer values recorded by flowmeters  installed on the permeate line of the plant, and the power consumption data  were collected from the Variable Frequency Drives (VFD) of the high-pressure  pump (HPP) and booster pump (BP) of the plant, as well as the plant’s common  control panel which also monitors other miscellaneous equipment such as valves.  The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system enables plant  operators to record and log data directly from their computer screens. During the  study period of, operators manually recorded the values hourly, and subsequently  compiled them into daily and weekly values for inclusions in monthly reports. The flowrate meters installed on the plant’s permeate lines provide the  instantaneous water production value in m³/h. The Variable Frequency Drives  (VFD) of the HPPs and the BPs along with the common control system (which  manages power for the miscellaneous equipment such as valves) supply plant’s  power consumption data. All these values essential for SEC calculations are  accessible on the SCADA system.  The total water production and power consumption of the plant are calculated  as monthly averages from the daily logged data. Each time CIP is performed, the amount of citric acid consumed, and the  volume of water used, are documented.

The energy required to maintain the pressure increases with increasing  membrane blockage due to fouling (Shouman et al., 2024). This increase in energy  requirement is reflected financially in the long term.  For change in SEC, the initial SEC with fresh membranes is used as the  reference point. Hence, the calculation in Equation 3 yields the additional energy  costs incurred due to membrane fouling. The cost of CIP is then added to these  values to calculate the total cost. The cumulative total is then taken for each month  until January 2024. Figure  2.2: The SEC can be plotted against the number of months to yield the graph . 12 The equation of the line fit of the data points is as follows: Where y is SEC in kWh/m³, and x is number of months. This equation was  then used to forecast the SEC increase past January 2024. For these forecasts,  the plant’s average production of 83,350.08 m³/month, was used. An annual  inflation rate of 3.9% (Ministry of Finance, 2023) was applied to the fuel price  and the cost of materials (for CIP and membranes) starting from January 2024.  The resulting SEC was then used with Equation 3 to calculate the total variable  cost for each of the corresponding months. During CIP procedure 100 kg of citric  acid and 5 m³ of water were used. The water is circulated for five hours, incurring  an energy cost of MVR 475.2. The cost of 100 kg of citric acid is MVR 2,121.92,  while the cost of water varies between MVR 34.60 and MVR 65.23 depending  on the SEC of the RO plant. Consequently, the total cost of CIP varies between  MVR 1,782.96 and MVR 3,973.48. Based on existing data the average interval  between CIP procedure is 152 days. There are no records of CIP being done after  December 2022 as the plant could not be shut down due to heightened water  demand. Hence, the ideal scenario is a projection where CIP is done every 152  days, which is assumed to cause a 0.02 kWh/m³ decrease in SEC (the minimum  SEC reduction that is caused by CIP, historically). An annual inflation rate of  3.9% is applied to costs, to account for rising expenses. For the projections of  this study, periodic membrane replacement assumes the replacement of all 216  membranes – or the number required to restore the desired/original performance  of the plant. With new membranes, it is assumed that the increase in SEC caused by  fouling will be 0 kWh/m³; resulting a default SEC of 2.4 kWh/m³ for the plant. This  represents a significant reduction in energy consumption. For instance, in January  2022, the plant’s SEC was 2.63 kWh/m³.

If the membranes had been replaced, the  SEC would have been reduced to 2.4 kWh/m³. This highlights the importance of  evaluating the cumulative energy savings associated with membrane replacement  accumulated over the time against the cost of the membrane replacement.  Hence, the costs are categorized into variable and fixed costs. Variable costs  include energy expenses incurred from plant operation and other costs associated  with CIP procedures, while the fixed costs comprise membrane replacement  expenses. The cumulative cost over time is used to analyze to assess how these  factors influence the total operational cost of the plant. This approach allows for  the evaluation of long-term impacts under different scenarios. Scenario 1 represents the current trajectory with inconsistent cleaning and  no periodic membrane replacement. Scenario 2 reflects the current trajectory  but accounts for consistent cleaning. Scenario 3 incorporate consistent cleaning  Evaluation of Effectiveness of Cleaning-in-Place of Membranes and Optimum  Period of Membrane Replacement on a Seawater Reverse Osmosis Plant  13 A.A.Najeeb et al. alongside periodic membrane replacement every four years. Scenario 4 includes  consistent cleaning with periodic membrane replacement every five years.  Currently, actual data is available from January 2018 to January 2024. The rest  of the data points beyond this period extending until January 2030 are projections  based on the calculations detailed earlier in this section. Results and Discussion  SEC Data and Curve  During the data collection, the SEC ranged between 2.4 kWh/m³ and 2.92 kWh/ m³. The increase of 0.52 kW/m³ is attributed to membrane fouling and aligns  with fouling-related SEC increment reported in the industry (Ruiz-García et al.,  2023).  While SEC fluctuations may result from changes in pump efficiency and  cost variations linked to engines performance, these factors are considered minor  compared to the rising power demand caused by membrane fouling. At the end  of the ideal 12- year trajectory, the cumulative CIP cost (of 12 years) is MVR  59,150.34. The small peaks 1 and 2 marked on Figure  2.2 are due to Unit 1 of  the plant being gradually turned off for increasingly extended periods each month  until it was fully offline in October 2020 (peak 1) for pump maintenance. This  also resulted in disproportionately higher fouling within the membranes of Unit  2 due to its continued operation. The module inlet pressures of Unit 1 and Unit  2 in November 2020 were 55.26 bar and 59.58 bar, respectively. Performing CIP  reduced these to 53.49 bar and 55.24 bar, respectively. The 3rd peak is attributed  to rapid membrane fouling, which was mitigated by replacing membranes on the  lead side of the vessels over three months.  Cleaning Costs  Considering the citric acid costs for various months, cleaning chemicals appear to  account for most of the total cost, followed by the energy costs.

This confirms that CIP costs are minor compared to the energy  costs associated with the arising from the increased energy demand of fouled  membranes. Cumulative Costs Comparison Figure  3.1: Cumulative costs of different scenarios across a period of 12 years. Figure 3.1 shows the cumulative costs of the four different scenarios mentioned  in the previous section. The breakeven of Scenario 2 against Scenario 1 is 74  months (6 years and 2 months). The breakeven of Scenario 3 is 73 months (6  years and 1 month) against Scenario 1, 76 months (6 years and 4 months) against  Scenario 2, and 60 months (five years) against Scenario 4. Scenario 1 is the most expensive option in the long term, as the accelerated fouling  of membranes significantly increases the system’s energy costs. In comparison,  Scenario 2 has a much flatter cost curve and with savings of MVR 25,620,359 over  the 12-year period. This is owed to the SEC decrement due to the cleaning of the  foulants in the membranes. Scenario 3 yields greater savings offering a savings of  MVR 31,090,464.1 compared to Scenario 1, and MVR 5,470,105.08 compared  to Scenario 2. While the savings of Scenario 3 fluctuate compared to Scenario 4, Figure  3.2  shows that there is an overall increasing savings trend. The trend line of Scenario  3 is less steep than that of Scenario 4, as seen in Figure  3.1 and Figure  3.2.  The primary savings here come from the variable savings, amounting to MVR  1,510,128.54. It is the fixed cost that is responsible for the fluctuations; with  sudden increases observed in both fixed cost curves of both scenarios (highlighted  in red rectangles on Figure  3.2) whenever membranes are replaced. For Scenario  3, the variable costs and fixed costs are 40% and 60% of the total cost, respectively.  In the case of Scenario 4, they are 53% and 47%, respectively.

Energy Consumption Comparison  The energy savings from periodic cleaning and membrane replacement is apparent  from the SEC comparison of the different Scenarios, shown in Figure  3.3. The  current trajectory with minimal cleaning and no membrane replacement reaches  an SEC of 4.24 kWh/m³ by January 2030, scenario 2 ends up with a maximum  SEC of 3.01 kWh/m³, whereas scenario 3 sees the SEC reach a maximum of 2.68  kWh/m³ before membrane replacement, and the SEC in scenario 4 reaches 2.78  kWh/m³ before membrane replacement. In terms of energy in kWh, Scenario 2  has a savings of 3,703,290.76 kWh over Scenario 1. Scenario 3 has savings of  5,971,342.90 kWh over Scenario 1, 2,268,052.14 kWh over Scenario 2, and  245,335.69 kWh over Scenario 4. Figure  3.3: SEC trend of different scenarios. A.A.Najeeb et al. 16 Figure  3.3 is important in characterizing the savings of Scenario 3 observed in  Figure  3.1. It is shown that the reduction in energy consumption and the less time  spent in higher-than-optimal SECs contribute towards a significant savings trend.  Scenario 4 spends an extra year running the plant at an SEC higher than 2.6 kWh/ m³. The maximum SEC of the RO process (excluding pre and post treatment)  reached at a MWSC plant is 3.2 kWh/m³. This is extremely dependent on the  permeate production of the plant in addition to the module inlet pressure. Hence,  it is possible for the SEC of a plant to increase beyond this value, if the membrane  fouling can cause a larger decrement in permeate production even if the pump  approaches its run-off point. Further Discussions  It is abundantly clear that most of the energy savings of Scenario 3 come from  the RO plant being operated at a lower SEC, which is made possible by periodic  membrane cleaning. Shortening the membrane replacement period to 4 years  – as implied by Scenario 3 being financially optimum – is not the solution; the  membranes should only be replaced when their performance cannot be recovered  by CIP procedures. Instead, it would be wiser to focus on implementing better  cleaning practices. Membrane cleaning via CIP is scheduled when the differential  pressure across the membrane increases past a certain point, causing the system  to run for extended durations on high differential pressure to maintain permeate  flow, leading to high power consumption (Ruiz-García et al., 2023). It is also  important to understand that untargeted general cleaning with citric acid alone  is insufficient to restore the performance of the membranes to full potential.

The results can be used to either enhance pretreatment and/or  develop specific cleaning regiments to target specific foulants. Effective cleaning  can prolong membrane life and keep the energy costs of the RO process low (S.  Pietsch, 2017). Predictive cleaning would also yield better results (Ruiz-García et  al., 2023), for which SEC can be monitored live alongside differential pressure as  markers of membrane fouling. In-situ detection of fouling via Electrical Impedance  Spectroscopy (EIS) is a new technology that is currently being tested. It has  proven to be more effective in providing early warning of biofouling compared  to monitoring differential pressure (H. Komori et al., 2018). There is potential  for EIS to be used to assess the biofouling potential of MWSC’s feed water in the  laboratory. Additionally, dedicating a plant to experimental studies would eliminate  many uncontrollable variables, such as water demand that may require membrane  replacement, and would provide higher quality data. Limitations There are limitations of this study that require elaboration, to frame the results in  context where it is necessary. The values used in the SEC calculation are obtained  from the monthly log sheets. The total production of each month is first calculated  by subtracting the totalizer values of the permeate flowmeter, and then the total  Evaluation of Effectiveness of Cleaning-in-Place of Membranes and Optimum  Period of Membrane Replacement on a Seawater Reverse Osmosis Plant  17 energy consumed by the plant is divided by this value. The resultant value is an  average and less accurate than if the SEC is calculated live based on the permeate  flowrate and instantaneous power consumption of the plant. This approach would  increase the resolution of the data collected, thereby improving the accuracy of the  resulting calculations. Some membranes from the lead side of the plant were replaced during the  period of this study due to rapid fouling and resultant SEC increment observed  in the third peak in Figure  2.2. The effect on SEC was gradual, as the membrane  replacement was done over the course of three months from April 2023 to July  2023. The resulting SEC decrement serves to balance the SEC increment due to  the rapid fouling, in effect mitigating an anomaly. This activity was carried out to  recover the plant’s production in order to meet the city’s water demand.

The SECflow can be calculated as follows: where Pfs is the feed pressure in Pa, Qf is the raw water flow m³/h, and Qps is the  normalized permeate flow in m³/h (Ruiz-García & Ruiz-Saavedra, 2015). Conclusion It is imperative to understand that membranes are replaced only when they are  irreversibly damaged, that is, when the conductivity of the permeate increases or  the permeate flow decreases and cannot be recovered by cleaning. Spiral-wound  SWRO membranes, such as the Hydranautics SWC5-LD, typically last 5-6 years  (Hydranautics, 2013), and this is true in the case of the plants being operated at  MWSC. However, membrane fouling is a major issue that increases the energy  demand of the SWRO process and drives up the variable costs of long-term plant  operations. The results presented in this study arise from a situation that might be  unique to the Maldivian islands; the increasing water demand, the lack of cleaning  windows for CIP, and unidentified foulants in the feed water that might not be  sufficiently removed during a cleaning regiment that employs citric acid alone, all  A.A.Najeeb et al. 18 compound to create a situation that, while still allowing for long membrane-life, has  huge potential for cost savings in replacing the membranes every 4 years. However,  the data discussed in the previous section elucidates that the savings of scenario 3  are owed to the plant being run at a lower SEC than scenario 4, which reinforces  the fact that there are more energy savings to be had in a holistic approach to  membrane cleaning. Hence, it is inaccurate to say that the shortened membrane  replacement period found to be economical in this study can be generally applied  to every other plant. The SEC-related findings are more prominent and applicable,  and the study highlights the importance of effective membrane cleaning rather  than promoting increasing the frequency of membrane replacement. It is not recommended to replace the membranes every 4 years to save costs,  rather it is recommended to focus on better cleaning strategies to save costs  and prolong the life of the membranes in the process. The findings confirm that  ineffective cleaning leads to increased energy costs and, subsequently, operational  costs. Evidence suggests that the current cleaning practices are insufficient and  leads to the accumulation of foulants within the membranes.

Key points include:\n\n1. **Fouling and Cleaning**: Fouling caused by biological matter is a significant issue in RO plants, leading to decreased membrane performance. CIP is a primary cleaning method where a cleaning agent circulates through the system to restore membrane function.\n\n2. **Membrane Replacement**: Membranes are typically discarded when their flow and quality drop by more than 15%. However, if cleaning is ineffective, continued use of fouled membranes can increase operational costs, particularly energy expenses.\n\n3. **Cost Analysis**: The study aims to evaluate the energy efficiency of CIP and determine the most cost-effective interval for membrane replacement (four vs. five years). It includes a breakeven analysis comparing the costs of membrane replacement with the cumulative costs incurred from not replacing membranes.\n\n4. **Research Design**: Data was collected from an operational SWRO plant at MWSC, which has a production capacity of 3000 m³/day and consists of 36 pressure vessels housing 216 membranes. The membranes are operated at a lower flux to minimize fouling.\n\n5. **Recommendations**: The study will outline the impact of ineffective cleaning on membrane lifespan and energy consumption, providing recommendations to enhance energy efficiency and extend the lifespan of the membranes.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to fouling management and cost-effective practices in membrane cleaning and replacement.\nThe document discusses the challenges and practices related to membrane fouling in seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination processes. Key points include:\n\n1. **Fouling Prevention and Cleaning**: Despite improvements in feed water treatment, complete prevention of fouling is not possible. Chemical and mechanical cleaning methods are used to mitigate performance degradation, but these must be carefully implemented to avoid damaging the membranes.\n\n2. **Specific Energy Consumption (SEC)**: The SEC for SWRO processes ranges from 2.3 to 3.0 kWh/m³, significantly higher than the theoretical energy requirement of 0.7 kWh/m³. Membrane fouling increases SEC, leading to higher energy demands and operating costs.\n\n3. **Cleaning Agents**: Different cleaning agents are used based on the type of fouling. Low pH cleaners like citric acid target scale minerals, while high pH cleaners address organic fouling. In severe cases, stronger chemicals like hydrochloric acid may be used, though they risk damaging the membrane.\n\n4. **Mechanical Cleaning Methods**: Techniques such as reverse flow cleaning are effective for removing biological fouling and particulates.\n\n5. **Cleaning-in-Place (CIP)**: CIP is a primary cleaning method where a cleaning agent circulates through the system while the plant is shut down. This method is integrated into RO plant designs for ease of operation.\n\n6. **Membrane Lifespan**: Membranes are typically discarded when their flow and quality drop by more than 15% from initial values, although they can be retained if cleaning restores performance.\n\nOverall, the document highlights the importance of managing fouling and cleaning processes to maintain membrane performance and reduce energy consumption in desalination plants.\nThe document discusses the energy consumption and cost implications of membrane replacement and cleaning in a seawater reverse osmosis plant. Key points include:\n\n1. **Energy Consumption**: The specific energy consumption (SEC) of the plant is projected to decrease from 2.63 kWh/m³ to 2.4 kWh/m³ with the replacement of membranes, highlighting significant energy savings.\n\n2. **Cost Analysis**: Costs are categorized into variable (energy expenses and cleaning costs) and fixed (membrane replacement expenses). The cumulative costs over time are analyzed to understand their impact on the plant's total operational costs.\n\n3. **Scenarios for Evaluation**: Four scenarios are outlined:\n   - Scenario 1: Inconsistent cleaning and no membrane replacement.\n   - Scenario 2: Inconsistent cleaning with consistent cleaning.\n   - Scenario 3: Consistent cleaning with membrane replacement every four years.\n   - Scenario 4: Consistent cleaning with membrane replacement every five years.\n\n4. **Data Collection**: Actual SEC data is available from January 2018 to January 2024, with projections extending to January 2030. The SEC has fluctuated between 2.4 kWh/m³ and 2.92 kWh/m³, primarily due to membrane fouling.\n\n5. **CIP Costs**: The cumulative cost of cleaning-in-place (CIP) over 12 years is MVR 59,150.34. Cleaning chemicals are the largest expense, followed by energy costs, while water costs are minimal.\n\n6. **Operational Challenges**: The document notes operational challenges, such as the impact of maintenance on fouling and the need for effective cleaning strategies to manage energy consumption and costs.\n\nOverall, the study emphasizes the importance of membrane replacement and consistent cleaning to optimize energy efficiency and reduce operational costs in the plant.\nThe document discusses the operation of a seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plant managed by MWSC, which began data collection in January 2018. Key points include:\n\n1. **Membrane Operation**: The membranes are rated for a permeate flow of 34.1 m³/day at a flux of 38.2 l/m²h, but MWSC operates them at a lower flux of 14-16 l/m²h to minimize fouling.\n\n2. **Feed Water Source**: The feed water is sourced from deep boreholes (30-50 meters) and undergoes multiple filtration stages (100 μm, 50 μm, and 5 μm) to remove particles, with no chemical pretreatment needed due to the naturally clean water.\n\n3. **Filtration and Pressure Boosting**: After filtration, the flow is split, with 30-35% directed to a high-pressure pump and the rest to a pressure exchanger (PX) for pressure boosting before entering the SWRO membranes.\n\n4. **Temperature Control**: The water temperature is maintained between 25°C and 27°C, which is not expected to significantly affect the processes.\n\n5. **Cleaning Procedure**: The cleaning-in-place (CIP) procedure involves flushing with permeate, circulating a cleaning solution for about five hours, rinsing, and operating in bypass mode until the permeate is clear. \n\n6. **Cleaning Recommendations**: Hydranautics advises against extreme pH and temperature during cleaning to protect membrane lifespan, recommending specific pH ranges based on temperature. Currently, MWSC uses citric acid as the cleaning agent. \n\nOverall, the document outlines the operational practices and maintenance procedures of the SWRO plant to ensure efficient water production while minimizing fouling and maintaining membrane integrity.\nThe document discusses the findings of a study on membrane cleaning in seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plants, emphasizing the importance of effective cleaning strategies over frequent membrane replacement. Key points include:\n\n1. **Membrane Cleaning vs. Replacement**: The study recommends focusing on improving membrane cleaning techniques rather than replacing membranes every four years, as better cleaning can save costs and extend membrane life.\n\n2. **Impact of Ineffective Cleaning**: Ineffective cleaning practices lead to increased energy and operational costs due to the accumulation of foulants on membranes.\n\n3. **Data Collection and Monitoring**: It suggests enhancing data collection through automated logging and implementing predictive cleaning based on live monitoring of specific parameters, such as SEC (suspended solids) and differential pressure.\n\n4. **Laboratory Experiments**: Conducting laboratory-scale experiments, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), is recommended to assess the fouling potential of feedwater.\n\n5. **Research Gaps**: There is a noted lack of research on SWRO process limitations and cleaning solutions specific to the Republic of Maldives, highlighting the need for extensive studies in this area.\n\n6. **Acknowledgments**: The document acknowledges contributions from various individuals involved in the research and data evaluation.\n\n7. **Conflict of Interest**: The authors disclose their employment with Malé Water and Sewerage Company Pvt. Ltd.\n\nOverall, the document calls for improved cleaning practices and further research to address the unique challenges faced by SWRO plants in the Maldives.\nThe document discusses the cleaning and maintenance of Hydranautics SWC5-LD membranes used in seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plants. Key points include:\n\n1. **Cleaning Recommendations**: Hydranautics advises against prolonged cleaning of membranes at extreme pH and temperature ranges, as it can enhance cleaning effectiveness but may reduce membrane lifespan. If extreme conditions are necessary, shorter contact times are recommended.\n\n2. **pH Ranges**: The acceptable pH ranges for cleaning vary with temperature: pH 1 to 12 for ≤25°C and ≤35°C, and pH 2 to 11 for ≤45°C. For continuous operations, a narrower pH range of 3 to 10.5 is suggested.\n\n3. **Cleaning Agents**: MWSC primarily uses citric acid for cleaning, which effectively targets scale and inorganic materials without compromising membrane integrity. Occasionally, caustic soda is used to adjust pH. Biological fouling is not currently addressed as it is not seen as a significant issue.\n\n4. **Data Collection**: Water production and power consumption data are collected via flowmeters and Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) connected to a SCADA system. Operators manually log data hourly, which is compiled into daily and monthly reports.\n\n5. **CIP Documentation**: Each cleaning-in-place (CIP) operation records the amount of citric acid and water used, as well as the power consumption of the CIP pump, allowing for cost calculations associated with the cleaning process.\n\n6. **Data Analysis**: The document outlines how Specific Energy Consumption (SEC) is calculated to measure energy efficiency in producing desalinated water, serving as an indicator of efficiency loss due to membrane fouling.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes the importance of proper cleaning protocols and data management to maintain membrane performance and efficiency in SWRO plants.\nThe document discusses various aspects of fouling control and membrane cleaning in reverse osmosis (RO) systems, particularly focusing on the use of saturated CO2 solutions for effective cleaning.

Key points include:\n\n1. **Fouling Impact**: Fouling reduces SWRO membrane performance by causing blockages, leading to increased pressure and decreased efficiency and water quality.\n\n2. **Membrane Lifespan**: The lifespan of RO membranes is influenced by feed water quality, membrane flux, and the extent of fouling/scaling.\n\n3. **CIP Practice**: Cleaning-in-place is a common method used to mitigate fouling in RO plants.\n\n4. **Financial Analysis**: The study compares the financial impacts of membrane replacement versus CIP on specific energy consumption (SEC) using operational data from January 2018 to January 2024.\n\n5. **Breakeven Analysis**: The breakeven point for replacing membranes every 4 years versus every 5 years is 5 years, and the breakeven for 4-year replacement against only using CIP is 6.08 years.\n\n6. **Energy Consumption**: On average, SEC improves by 0.07 kWh/m³ after CIP. Replacing membranes every 4 years results in the lowest energy consumption and cumulative costs over a 12-year period.\n\n7. **Fouling Challenges**: Despite advancements in treatment, complete prevention of fouling is not possible, and cleaning processes must be carefully managed to avoid damaging membranes.\n\n8. **SEC Benchmark**: The average SEC for global desalination processes is between 2.3–3.0 kWh/m³, serving as a key indicator of energy efficiency in water production.\n\nOverall, the study emphasizes the importance of effective membrane management and cleaning strategies to optimize performance and reduce costs in SWRO plants.\nThe document discusses the energy requirements and costs associated with membrane replacement and cleaning in a seawater reverse osmosis (RO) plant. Key points include:\n\n1. **Specific Energy Consumption (SEC)**: SEC is a measure of energy efficiency, indicating the energy required to produce one unit of desalinated water. It is affected by membrane fouling, which increases energy requirements and costs.\n\n2. **Data Analysis**: The energy consumption and water production data are used to calculate SEC and Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC). The initial SEC with fresh membranes serves as a reference for assessing the impact of fouling.\n\n3. **Cost Implications**: The additional energy costs due to membrane fouling are calculated, and the cost of cleaning in place (CIP) is added to determine total costs. The cumulative costs are tracked monthly until January 2024.\n\n4. **CIP Procedure**: The CIP process involves using citric acid and water, with associated costs varying based on SEC. The average interval between CIP procedures is 152 days, and historical data suggests a minimum SEC reduction of 0.02 kWh/m³ from CIP.\n\n5. **Membrane Replacement**: The study assumes periodic replacement of all 216 membranes to restore original plant performance, resulting in a default SEC of 2.4 kWh/m³. This replacement is projected to significantly reduce energy consumption compared to the current SEC of 2.63 kWh/m³.\n\n6. **Inflation Considerations**: An annual inflation rate of 3.9% is applied to fuel prices and material costs starting January 2024, affecting overall cost projections.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes the importance of monitoring SEC and the financial implications of membrane fouling and replacement in maintaining the efficiency of the RO plant.\nThe document discusses the importance of improving cleaning practices for membranes in a seawater reverse osmosis (RO) plant, emphasizing that relying solely on cleaning-in-place (CIP) procedures is insufficient. Key points include:\n\n1. **CIP Limitations**: CIP is triggered by increased differential pressure, which can lead to high power consumption and prolonged operation under stress.\n\n2. **Ineffectiveness of General Cleaning**: Using citric acid alone for cleaning does not fully restore membrane performance, as indicated by persistent specific energy consumption (SEC) increments.\n\n3. **Foulant Identification**: Conducting membrane autopsies can help identify foulants, allowing for enhanced pretreatment and targeted cleaning regimens, which can prolong membrane life and reduce energy costs.\n\n4. **Predictive Cleaning**: Monitoring SEC and differential pressure in real-time can improve cleaning effectiveness. New technologies like Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) show promise for early detection of biofouling.\n\n5. **Experimental Studies**: Dedicating a plant for experimental studies can help eliminate variables that affect data quality, such as water demand.\n\n6. **Study Limitations**: The study's SEC calculations are based on monthly averages, which may lack accuracy compared to real-time data. Membrane replacements during the study period could have skewed SEC results.\n\n7. **SEC Measurement**: The study uses \"real SEC,\" which accounts for the actual energy consumption of the plant, providing a more accurate assessment of energy efficiency.\n\nOverall, the document advocates for improved cleaning strategies and better data collection methods to enhance the performance and efficiency of RO membranes.\nThe document discusses the challenges and considerations related to energy consumption and membrane fouling in seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plants. Key points include:\n\n1. **Fouling and Energy Consumption**: Rapid fouling can impact the specific energy consumption (SEC) of the plant, which is crucial for meeting water demand. The study emphasizes the need to avoid practices that could skew SEC data in future assessments.\n\n2. **SEC Measurement**: The study uses \"SEC real,\" calculated from the total energy consumption of the plant, which accounts for the efficiency of pumps and motors. However, \"SECflow,\" calculated from pressure and flow rate, may better capture the energy impact of membrane fouling.\n\n3. **Membrane Replacement**: Membranes are typically replaced only when irreversibly damaged. While SWRO membranes can last 5-6 years, the study suggests that operational conditions in the Maldivian islands may lead to increased fouling and potential cost savings by replacing membranes every 4 years.\n\n4. **Cleaning Strategies**: The findings indicate that effective membrane cleaning is crucial for reducing energy and operational costs. Current cleaning practices are deemed insufficient, leading to foulant accumulation.\n\n5. **Recommendations**: The document recommends focusing on improved cleaning strategies rather than increasing membrane replacement frequency.

    "output": "The collection of documents provides a detailed examination of the challenges and practices associated with membrane fouling and cleaning in seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plants, particularly focusing on the operations at the Maldives Water and Sewerage Company (MWSC). The key themes and findings can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Fouling and Its Impact**: Membrane fouling, primarily caused by biological matter and other contaminants, significantly reduces the performance of SWRO membranes. This leads to increased pressure, decreased efficiency, and lower water quality, ultimately raising operational costs due to higher specific energy consumption (SEC).\n\n2. **Membrane Lifespan and Replacement**: The lifespan of RO membranes is influenced by factors such as feed water quality, membrane flux, and the extent of fouling. Membranes are typically replaced when their flow and quality drop by more than 15%. The study evaluates the financial implications of replacing membranes every four versus five years, with a breakeven analysis indicating that replacing membranes every four years is more cost-effective in the long run.\n\n3. **Cleaning-in-Place (CIP) Practices**: CIP is a common method employed to mitigate fouling, involving the circulation of cleaning agents through the system while the plant is offline. The effectiveness of CIP is crucial, as inadequate cleaning can lead to increased energy consumption and operational costs. The study emphasizes the need for careful management of cleaning processes to avoid damaging membranes.\n\n4. **Energy Consumption and Cost Analysis**: The SEC for SWRO processes is significantly higher than the theoretical energy requirement, primarily due to fouling. The documents outline various scenarios for evaluating the cost implications of cleaning and membrane replacement, highlighting that effective cleaning can lead to substantial energy savings and reduced operational costs.\n\n5. **Cleaning Agents and Methods**: Different cleaning agents are employed based on the type of fouling, with citric acid being the primary agent used by MWSC. The documents discuss the importance of targeted cleaning practices and the potential benefits of using advanced cleaning methods, such as saturated CO2 solutions, to enhance cleaning effectiveness.\n\n6. **Data Collection and Monitoring**: The importance of accurate data collection and monitoring is emphasized, with recommendations for automated logging and real-time monitoring of SEC and differential pressure to improve cleaning strategies. The study also suggests conducting laboratory experiments to better understand fouling potential and optimize cleaning protocols.\n\n7. **Recommendations for Improvement**: The documents advocate for a holistic approach to fouling management, emphasizing the need for improved cleaning practices over frequent membrane replacement. Identifying foulants through membrane autopsies and implementing predictive cleaning strategies are recommended to enhance membrane performance and extend their lifespan.\n\n8. **Research Gaps and Future Directions**: The study identifies a lack of research specific to the challenges faced by SWRO plants in the Maldives, calling for further investigation into effective cleaning solutions and operational strategies tailored to local conditions.\n\nOverall, the documents underscore the critical role of effective membrane management, cleaning strategies, and data-driven decision-making in optimizing the performance and cost-effectiveness of SWRO plants. The findings highlight the need for continuous improvement in cleaning practices to mitigate fouling, reduce energy consumption, and enhance the longevity of RO membranes."

Current insights into weight initialization come primarily from linear activation functions. In this paper, I develop a theory for weight initializations with non-linear activations. First, I derive a general weight initialization strategy for any neural network using activation functions diﬀerentiable at 0. Next, I derive the weight initialization strategy for the Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (RELU), and provide theoretical insights into why theXavier initializationis a poor choice with RELU activations. My analysis provides a clear demonstration of the role of non-linearities in determining the proper weight initializations. 1 Introduction In recent years, there have been rapid advances in our understanding of deep neural networks. These advances have resulted in breakthroughs in several ﬁelds, ranging from image recognition ([13],[18],[19]) to speech recognition ([5],[11],[17]) to natural language processing ([2],[8], [15]). These successes have been achieved despite the notorious diﬃculty in training these deep models. Part of the diﬃculty in training these models lies in determining the proper initialization strategy for the parameters in the model. It is well known [12] that arbitrary initializations can slow down or even completely stall the convergence process. The slowdown arises because arbitrary initializations can result in the deeper layers receiving inputs with small variances, which in turn slows down back propagation, and retards the overall convergence process. Weight initialization is an area of active research, and numerous methods ([12], [14], [16] to state a few) have been proposed to deal with the problem of the shrinking variance in the deeper layers. In this paper, I revisit the oldest, and most widely used approach to the problem with the goal of resolving some of the unanswered theoretical questions which remain in the literature. The problem can be stated as follows: If the weights in a neural network are initialized using samples from a normal distribution,N(0,v2), how shouldv2 be chosen to ensure that the variance of the outputs from the diﬀerent layers are approximately the same? The ﬁrst systematic analysis of this problem was conducted by Glorot and Bengio [3] who showed that for a linear activation function, the optimal value ofv2 = 1/N, whereN is the number of nodes feeding into that layer. Although the paper makes several assumptions about the inputs to the model, it works extremely well in many cases and is widely used in the initialization of neural networks to date; this initialization scheme is commonly referred to as theXavier initialization. In an important follow up paper, He and colleagues [6] argue that theXavier initializationdoes not work well with the RELU activation function, and instead propose an initialization ofv2 = 2/N (commonly referred to as theHe initialization). In support of their initialization, they provide an example of a 30 layer neural network which converges with theHe initialization, but not under the Xavier initialization. To the best of my knowledge, the precise reason for the convergence of one method and the non-convergence of the other is not fully understood. My main contributions in this paper are to (a) generalize the results of [3] to the case of non-linear activation functions and (b) to provide a continuum between the results of [3] and [6]. For the class of activation functions diﬀerentiable at 0, I provide a general initialization strategy. For the class of activation functions that are not diﬀerentiable at 0, I focus on the Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (RELU) and provide a rigorous proof of theHe initialization.

As a small bonus, I resolve an unanswered question posed in [3] regarding the distributions of activations under the hyperbolic tangent activation. 1 arXiv:1704.08863v2  [cs.LG]  2 May 2017 2 The setup Consider a deep neural network withM layers. The relationship between the inputs to themth layer (xm) andm+ 1th layer (xm+1) are described by the recursions ym(i) = j=N∑ j=1 Wm(i,j)xm(j) = j=N∑ j=1 pij (1) and xm+1(i) =g(ym(i)). (2) Here pj = Wm(i,j)xm(j), Wm is a matrix of weights for themth layer,gis the non-linear activation function, andN is the number of nodes in the hidden layers respectively. The weightsWm(i,j) are assumed to be independent identically distributed normal random variables with mean 0 and variance v2. Consistent with the assumptions in [3] and [6], I assume that the inputs to the ﬁrst layer are independent and identically distributed random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. For convenience, I userm and u2 m to denote the mean and variance ofym(i) respectively. Due to the symmetry in the problem, all inputs to themth layer will have the same means and variances during the ﬁrst forward pass (i.e.,E(xm(i)) =µm and Var(xm(i)) =s2 m for alli); the covariances between the inputs to themth layer need not be 0. The goal is to ﬁnd the value ofv2 which ensures thats2 1 ≈s2 2... ≈s2 M = 1 during the ﬁrst forward pass. To accomplish this, I need to express the central moments ofxm+1(i) in terms of the central moments ofxm(i) for an arbitrary value ofm. I begin by analyzing properties of the neural network that are independent of the activation function considered in the analysis. Proposition 1. During the ﬁrst iteration,Wm(i,j) is independent ofxm(k) for all values ofi,j and k Using the recursions in (1) and (2),xm(k) can be expressed as some non-linear function of the weights in the ﬁrstm−1 layers, and the inputs to the ﬁrst layer. Since the weights in the mth layer are independent of the inputs to the ﬁrst layer and the weights in all other lay-ers, the weights in themth layer will also be independent of any non-linear function of these quantities. Therefore,Wm(i,j) is independent ofxm(k) for all values ofi,j and k. Furthermore,\n\nPlease summarize the main points of the content.\nAnswer:",

Under this assumption, we have the following result Proposition 2. ym(i) will be approximately normally distributed for all values ofm and i. For the ﬁrst iteration, note thatE(pij) = E(Wm(i,j)xm(j)) = E(Wm(i,j)) E(xm(j)) = 0. Furthermore, forj ̸= k, Cov(pij,pik) =E(pijpik) −E(pij)E(pik) = E(pijpik) = E(Wm(i,j)xm(j)Wm(i,k)xm(k)) = 0, (7) where the last equality follows from (5). This implies thatpi1, pi2 ... piN are independent and identically distributed random variables. Therefore by the Central Limit Theorem, we expect ym(i) = j=N∑ j=1 pij to converge to a normal distribution whenN is large [10]. Even whenpi1, pi2 ... piN are dependent and not identically distributed, the conditions required to ensure thatym(i) = j=N∑ j=1 pij converges to a normal distribution are weak (for a list of all the conditions, see Theorem 2.8.2 in [10]). Thus,ym(i) is expected to to be approximately normally distributed during most iterations. The analysis thus far has focused on providing general insights into the distribution ofym(i) resulting from equation (1). In order to analyze the role of the non-linearity induced by (2), assumptions need to be made about the nature ofg(x). In particular, my analysis critically hinges on the diﬀerentiability ofg(x) at 0. Accordingly, I split the analysis into two cases. The ﬁrst case deals with the general class of activation functions diﬀerentiable at 0. In the second case, instead of considering all possible non-diﬀerentiable functions, I focus on the Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (RELU) which is commonly used in the analysis of neural networks. 3 Activation functions diﬀerentiable at 0 When g(x) is diﬀerentiable at 0, we can perform a Taylor expansion in (2) aboutE(ym(i)) = 0.

Plugging these results in (12) yields v≈ 1√ N , (14) which is precisely theXavier Initialization. Sequential saturation with the hyperbolic tangent In their analysis of a neural network with the hyperbolic tangent activations, [3] ﬁnd that the deeper layers in the neural network have a greater proportion of unsaturated nodes than the shallower layers. As is stated in their paper, ‘why this is happening remains to be understood’. To explain their ﬁnding, I begin by noting that in [3], the authors initialize the weights using samples from a uniform distribution ( U[−1/ √ N,1/ √ N] ) having a variance of1/3N. Therefore, from (10) and (11), withg(0) = 0and g′(0) = 1, we haveµm = 0and 1In their calculations, [3] and [6] impose an additional set of constraints to ensure that the variance is maintained even during the backward pass.

The dataset comprises 50,000 training examples (which forms the training dataset in my analyses) and 10,000 test examples (which forms the validation dataset in my analyses).

These approximations are remarkably accurate, as is demonstrated by comparisons with the simulation experiments described in Figure 4.

Finally, I show why theXavier initializationfails to work with the RELU activation function.

Bayesia n inference is espe-cially compelling for deep neural networks. (1) Neural netw orks are typically underspeciﬁed by the data, and can represent many diﬀerent b ut high perform-ing models corresponding to diﬀerent settings of parameter s, which is exactly when marginalization will make the biggest diﬀerence for bo th calibration and accuracy . (2) Deep ensembles have been mistaken as competin g approaches to Bayesian methods, but can be seen as approximate Bayesian ma rginalization. (3) The structure of neural networks gives rise to a structur ed prior in function space, which reﬂects the inductive biases of neural network s that help them gen-eralize. (4) The observed correlation between parameters i n ﬂat regions of the loss and a diversity of solutions that provide good generali zation is further con-ducive to Bayesian marginalization, as ﬂat regions occupy a large volume in a high dimensional space, and each diﬀerent solution will mak e a good contribu-tion to a Bayesian model average. (5) Recent practical advan ces for Bayesian deep learning provide improvements in accuracy and calibra tion compared to standard training, while retaining scalability . In many situations, the predictive distribution we want to c ompute is given by p(y|x, D) = ∫ p(y|x, w )p(w|D)dw . (1) The outputs are y (e.g., class labels, regression values, . . . ), indexed by in puts x (e.g. im-ages, spatial locations, . . . ), the weights (or parameters) of the model f(x; w) are w, and D are the data. Eq. ( 1) represents a Bayesian model average (BMA). Rather than bet everything on one hypothesis — with a single setting of param eters w — we want to use every possible setting of parameters, weighted by their pos terior probabilities. This process is called marginalization of the parameters w, since the predictive distribution of interest no longer conditions on w. This is not a controversial equation, but a direct expressi on of the sum and product rules of probability . The BMA represents epistemic uncertainty — that is, uncertainty over which setting of weights (hypothe sis) is correct, given limited data. Epistemic uncertainty is sometimes referred to as model uncertainty , in contrast to aleatoric 1 uncertainty coming from noise in the measurement process. O ne can naturally visualize epistemic uncertainty in regression, by looking at the spre ad of the predictive distribution as we move in x space. As we move away from the data, there are many more funct ions that are consistent with our observations, and so our episte mic uncertainty should grow. In classical training, one typically ﬁnds the regularized maximum likelihood solution ˆw = argmaxw log p(w|D) =argmaxw(log p(D|w) + logp(w) +constant). (2) This procedure is sometimes called maximum a-posteriori (MAP) optimization , as it in-volves maximizing a posterior. log p(D|w) is the log likelihood, formed by relating the function we want to learn f(x; w) to our observations.

    "output": "The document discusses the concept of epistemic uncertainty in regression, emphasizing how uncertainty increases as we move away from the data. It contrasts classical training methods, specifically maximum a-posteriori (MAP) optimization, with Bayesian approaches. Key points include:\n\n1. **Epistemic Uncertainty**: As we move further from the observed data, the range of functions consistent with the data increases, leading to greater uncertainty.\n\n2. **MAP Optimization**: This method involves maximizing the posterior distribution of model parameters given the data, combining the likelihood of the data and a prior distribution. In regression with Gaussian noise, this corresponds to minimizing a scaled mean squared error (MSE) loss.\n\n3. **Role of Priors**: A flat prior does not influence the optimization solution but can significantly affect marginalization. MAP is not fully Bayesian as it focuses on a single hypothesis rather than exploring the posterior distribution.\n\n4. **Approximate Bayesian Inference**: Classical training can be viewed as an approximation of Bayesian inference, where the posterior is approximated as a Dirac delta function centered on the MAP estimate.\n\n5. **Posterior Characteristics**: The effectiveness of classical versus Bayesian approaches depends on the sharpness of the posterior distribution. In cases where the posterior is diffuse, as is common with deep neural networks, many different parameter settings can yield similar performance.\n\n6. **Diversity of Solutions**: Research indicates that neural networks can have multiple high-performing solutions, suggesting the need for Bayesian model averaging to capture this diversity and improve accuracy and calibration.\n\nOverall, the document advocates for Bayesian approaches in scenarios where model uncertainty is high, particularly in the context of deep learning."

In classical training, one typically ﬁnds the regularized maximum likelihood solution ˆw = argmaxw log p(w|D) =argmaxw(log p(D|w) + logp(w) +constant). (2) This procedure is sometimes called maximum a-posteriori (MAP) optimization , as it in-volves maximizing a posterior. log p(D|w) is the log likelihood, formed by relating the function we want to learn f(x; w) to our observations. If we are performing classiﬁcation with a softmax link function, − log p(D|w) corresponds to the cross entropy loss. If we are are performing regression with Gaussian noise, such tha t p(D|w) =∏ n j=1 p(yj |w, x j ) =∏ n j=1 N (yj ; f(xi; w), σ 2), then − log p(D|w) is a scaled MSE loss. In this context, the prior p(w) acts as a regularizer. If we choose a ﬂat prior, which has no preference for any sett ing of the parameters w (it does not assign any feasible setting any more prior densi ty than any other), then it will have no eﬀect on the optimization sol ution. On the other hand, a ﬂat prior may have a major eﬀect on marginalization. Indeed, even though MAP involves a posterior and a prior, and an instantiation of Bayes rule, i t is not at all Bayesian, since it is performing optimization to bet everything on a single hyp othesis f(x; ˆw). W e can view classical training as performing approximate Ba yesian inference, using the approximate posterior p(w|D) ≈ δ(w = ˆw), where δ is a Dirac delta function that is zero ev-erywhere except at ˆw. In this case, we recover the standard predictive distribut ion p(y|x, ˆw). F rom this perspective, many alternatives, albeit imperfec t, will be preferable — including impoverished Gaussian posterior approximations for p(w|D), even if the posterior or likeli-hood are actually highly non-Gaussian and multimodal. The diﬀerence between a classical and Bayesian approach wil l depend on how sharply peaked the posterior p(w|D) becomes. If the posterior is sharply peaked, there may be alm ost no diﬀerence, since a point mass may then be a reasonable approx imation of the posterior. However, deep neural networks are typically very underspec iﬁed by the available data, and will thus have diﬀuse likelihoods p(D|w). Not only are the likelihoods diﬀuse, but diﬀerent settings of the parameters correspond to a diverse variety o f compelling explanations for the data. Indeed, Garipov et al. (2018) shows that there are large valleys in the loss landscape of neural networks, over which parameters incur very little loss, but give rise to high per-forming functions which make meaningfully diﬀerent predic tions on test data. Zołna et al. (2019) and Izmailov et al. (2019) also demonstrate the variety of good solutions that can be expressed by a neural network posterior.

This is exactly the setting when we most want to perform a Bayesian model average, which will lead to an ensem ble containing many diﬀer-ent but high performing models, for better accuracy and bett er calibration than classical training. The recent success of deep ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al. , 2017) is not discouraging, but indeed strong motivation for following a Bayesian appro ach. Deep ensembles involves MAP training of the same architecture many times starting from diﬀerent random initializa-tions, to ﬁnd diﬀerent local optima. Thus using these models in an ensemble is an approxi-mate Bayesian model average , with weights that correspond to models with high likelihoo d and diverse predictions. Instead of using a single point mas s to approximate our posterior, as with classical training, we are now using multiple point m asses in good locations, en-abling a better approximation to the integral in Eq. ( 1) that we are trying to solve. The functional diversity is important for a good approximation to the BMA integral, because we are summing together terms of the form p(y|x, w ); if two settings of the weights wi and wj each provide high likelihood (and consequently high poster ior density), but give rise to similar models, then they will be largely redundant in the mo del average, and the second setting of parameters will not contribute much to the integr al estimate. The deep ensemble 2 weights can be viewed as samples from an approximate posteri or ( Gustafsson et al. , 2019). But in the context of deep ensembles, it is best to think of the BMA integral separately from the simple Monte Carlo approximation that is often used to approximate this integral; to compute an accurate predictive distribution, we do not ne ed samples from a posterior, or even a faithful approximation to the posterior. W e need to ev aluate the posterior in places that will make the greatest contributions to the integral of Eq. ( 1). While a recent report ( Ovadia et al. , 2019) shows that deep ensembles appear to outperform some particular approaches to Bayesian neural networks, th ere are two key reasons behind these results that are actually optimistic for Bayesian app roaches. First, the deep ensembles being used are ﬁnding many diﬀerent basins of attraction, co rresponding to diverse solutions, which enables a better approximation to a Bayesian model average than the speciﬁc Bayesian methods considered in Ovadia et al. (2019), which focus their modelling eﬀort on a single basin of attraction. The second is that the deep ensembles re quire retraining a network from scratch many times, which incurs a great computational expe nse. If one were to control for computation, the approaches which focus on a single basin ma y be preferred. There is an important distinction between a Bayesian model a verage and some approaches to ensembling. The Bayesian model average assumes that one hypothesis (one setting of the weights) is correct, and averages over models due to an inabi lity to distinguish between hy-potheses given limited data ( Minka, 2000).

If the true explanation for the data is actually a combination of hypotheses, the Bayesian model aver-age may then perform worse as we observe more data. Some ensem bling methods instead work by enriching the hypothesis space, and thus do not colla pse in this way . Deep ensem-bles, however, are ﬁnding diﬀerent MAP or maximum likelihoo d solutions, corresponding to diﬀerent basins of attraction, starting from diﬀerent rand om initializations. Therefore the deep ensemble will collapse when the posterior concentrate s, as with a Bayesian model aver-age. Since the hypothesis space is highly expressive for a mo dern neural network, posterior collapse in many cases is desirable. Regarding priors, the prior that matters is the prior infunction space , not parameter space. In the case of a Gaussian process (e.g. Williams and Rasmussen , 2006), a vague prior would be disastrous, as it is a prior directly in function space and would correspond to white noise. However, when we combine a vague prior over parameter s p(w) with a structured function form f(x; w) such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), we induce a str uctured prior distribution over functions p(f(x; w)). Indeed, the inductive biases and equivariance constraints in such models is why they work well in classical settings. W e can sample from this induced prior over functions by ﬁrst sampling para meters from p(w) and then conditioning on these parameters in f(x; w) to form a sample from p(f(x; w)) (e.g., Wilson, 2014, Ch 2). Alternatively , we can use a neural network kernel wit h a Gaussian process, to induce a structured distribution over functions ( Wilson et al. , 2016). Bayesian or not, the prior, just like the functional form of a model, or the likelihood, will certainly be imperfect, and making unassailable assumptio ns will be impossible. Attempting to avoid an important part of the modelling process because o ne has to make assumptions, however, will often be a worse alternative than an imperfect assumption. There are many considerations one might have in selecting a prior. Sometim es a consideration is invariance under reparametrization. Parametrization invariance is a lso a question in considering regu-larizers, optimization procedures, model speciﬁcation, e tc., and is not speciﬁc to whether or not one should follow a Bayesian approach. Nonetheless, we w ill make some brief additional remarks on these questions. If we truly have a vague prior over parameters, perhaps subject to some constraint for normalization, then our posterior reﬂects essentially the same relative preferences between models as our likelihood, for it is a likelihood scaled by a fa ctor that does not depend on 3\n\nPlease summarize the main points of the content.\nAnswer:",

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowl-edge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-speciﬁc architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric mem-ory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We com-pare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages per token. We ﬁne-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-speciﬁc retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we ﬁnd that RAG models generate more speciﬁc, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline. 1 Introduction Pre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowl-edge from data [47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized implicit knowledge base [51, 52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down-sides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into their predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric memory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [20, 26, 48] can address some of these issues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be inspected and interpreted.

Here, we bring hybrid parametric and non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. We endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The retriever (Dense Passage Retriever [26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on the input, and the seq2seq model (BART [32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with the input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation, either on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token basis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens).

In contrast, we explore a setting where both parametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive knowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is present without additional training. Our results highlight the beneﬁts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera-tion for knowledge-intensive tasks—tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform without access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results on open Natural Questions [29], WebQuestions [3] and CuratedTrec [2] and strongly outperform recent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [24]. Despite these being extractive tasks, we ﬁnd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches. For knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [1] and Jeopardy question generation, and we ﬁnd that our models generate responses that are more factual, speciﬁc, and diverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [56] fact veriﬁcation, we achieve results within 4.3% of state-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that the non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1 2 Methods We explore RAG models, which use the input sequencex to retrieve text documents z and use them as additional context when generating the target sequence y . As shown in Figure 1, our models leverage two components: (i) a retriever p η(z |x ) with parameters η that returns (top-K truncated) distributions over text passages given a query x and (ii) a generator p θ(y i |x,z,y 1:i −1) parametrized 1Code to run experiments with RAG has been open-sourced as part of the HuggingFace Transform-ers Library [66] and can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/ examples/rag/. An interactive demo of RAG models can be found at https://huggingface.co/rag/ 2 by θthat generates a current token based on a context of the previous i−1 tokens y1:i−1, the original input xand a retrieved passage z. To train the retriever and generator end-to-end, we treat the retrieved document as a latent variable. We propose two models that marginalize over the latent documents in different ways to produce a distribution over generated text. In one approach, RAG-Sequence, the model uses the same document to predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token, can predict each target token based on a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the pη and pθ components, as well as the training and decoding procedure. 2.1 Models RAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate the complete sequence. Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that is marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y|x) via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence\n\nPlease summarize the main points of the content.\nAnswer:",

Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that is marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y|x) via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence probability for each document, which are then marginalized, pRAG-Sequence(y|x) ≈ ∑ z∈top-k(p(·|x)) pη(z|x)pθ(y|x,z) = ∑ z∈top-k(p(·|x)) pη(z|x) N∏ i pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1) RAG-Token Model In the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each target token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several documents when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document, before marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne: pRAG-Token(y|x) ≈ N∏ i ∑ z∈top-k(p(·|x)) pη(z|x)pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1) Finally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class as a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent. 2.2 Retriever: DPR The retrieval component pη(z|x) is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture: pη(z|x) ∝exp ( d(z)⊤q(x) ) d(z) =BERTd(z), q(x) =BERTq(x) where d(z) is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERTBASE document encoder [8], and q(x) a query representation produced by a query encoder, also based on BERTBASE. Calculating top-k(pη(·|x)), the list of kdocuments zwith highest prior probability pη(z|x), is a Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [23]. We use a pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This retriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [24] questions and Natural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory. 2.3 Generator: BART The generator component pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1) could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use BART-large [32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input xwith the retrieved content zwhen generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was pre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained\n\nPlease summarize the main points of the content.\nAnswer:",

We use BART-large [32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input xwith the retrieved content zwhen generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was pre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5 models [32]. We refer to the BART generator parameters θas the parametric memory henceforth. 2.4 Training We jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what document should be retrieved. Given a ﬁne-tuning training corpus of input/output pairs (xj,yj), we 3 minimize the negative marginal log-likelihood of each target, ∑ j−log p(yj|xj) using stochastic gradient descent with Adam [28]. Updating the document encoder BERTd during training is costly as it requires the document index to be periodically updated as REALM does during pre-training [20]. We do not ﬁnd this step necessary for strong performance, and keep the document encoder (and index) ﬁxed, only ﬁne-tuning the query encoder BERTq and the BART generator. 2.5 Decoding At test time, RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token require different ways to approximatearg maxyp(y|x). RAG-Token The RAG-Token model can be seen as a standard, autoregressive seq2seq genera-tor with transition probability: p′ θ(yi|x,y1:i−1) = ∑ z∈top-k(p(·|x)) pη(zi|x)pθ(yi|x,zi,y1:i−1) To decode, we can plug p′ θ(yi|x,y1:i−1) into a standard beam decoder. RAG-Sequence For RAG-Sequence, the likelihood p(y|x) does not break into a conventional per-token likelihood, hence we cannot solve it with a single beam search. Instead, we run beam search for each document z, scoring each hypothesis using pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1). This yields a set of hypotheses Y, some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability of an hypothesis y we run an additional forward pass for each document z for which y does not appear in the beam, multiply generator probability with pη(z|x) and then sum the probabilities across beams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer output sequences, |Y|can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding, we can make a further approximation that pθ(y|x,zi) ≈0 where ywas not generated during beam search from x,zi. This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Y has been generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.” 3 Experiments We experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks.

It shows a high overlap with gold evidence articles, with 71% of the top retrieved documents being from gold articles.\n\n2. **Generation Diversity**: RAG models demonstrate greater factuality and specificity in Jeopardy question generation compared to BART.

This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Y has been generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.” 3 Experiments We experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use a single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and Karpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint 100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an embedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [23] with a Hierarchical Navigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [37]. During training, we retrieve the top kdocuments for each query. We consider k∈{5,10}for training and set kfor test time using dev data. We now discuss experimental details for each task. 3.1 Open-domain Question Answering Open-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed for knowledge-intensive tasks [20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x,y) and train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to the popular extractive QA paradigm [5, 7, 31, 26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved documents, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book QA” approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead relying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural Questions (NQ) [29], TriviaQA (TQA) [24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [2]. As CT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG model. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [ 31, 26] and report Exact Match (EM) scores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set. 3.2 Abstractive Question Answering RAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive text generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting, we use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [ 43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages retrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the retrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat 4 MSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be answered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as “What is the weather in V olcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages. We also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here, RAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses. 3.3 Jeopardy Question Generation To evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen-\n\nPlease summarize the main points of the content.\nAnswer:",

Here, RAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses. 3.3 Jeopardy Question Generation To evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen-eration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist of short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions. Jeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity. For example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the ﬁrst country to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise, factual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a challenging knowledge-intensive generation task. We use the splits from SearchQA [ 10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As this is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [67], we evaluate using the SQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [ 42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for matching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than standard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and one for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external sources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [ 33]. We follow best practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two generated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four options—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good. 3.4 Fact Veriﬁcation FEVER [ 56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by Wikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving evidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify whether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem coupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for exploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map FEVER class labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with claim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on retrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and models that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore two variants: the standard 3-way classiﬁcation task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way (supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy. 4 Results 4.1 Open-domain Question Answering Table 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models.

On all four open-domain QA tasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines the generation ﬂexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of \"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results without expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s retriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions and TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “cross-encoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a re-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance. There are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them. Docu-ments with clues about the answer but do not contain the answer verbatim can still contribute towards a correct answer being generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading 5 Table 1: Open-Domain QA Test Scores.

RAG approaches state-of-the-art model performance, which is impressive given that (i) those models access gold passages with speciﬁc information required to generate the reference answer , (ii) many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and (iii) not all questions are answerable from Wikipedia alone. Table 3 shows some generated answers from our models. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually correct text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than BART generations (see §4.5). 4.3 Jeopardy Question Generation Table 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation, with both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452 pairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more factual than RAG in only 7.1% of cases, while RAG was more factual in 42.7% of cases, and both RAG and BART were factual in a further 17% of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG on the task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also ﬁnd RAG generations to be more speciﬁc by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model. Jeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform best because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows an example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The Sun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is generated. Intriguingly, after the ﬁrst token of each book is generated, the document posterior ﬂattens. This observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on speciﬁc documents. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufﬁcient to complete the titles.

RAG achieves an accuracy within 2.7% of this model, despite being supplied with only the claim and retrieving its own evidence. We also analyze whether documents retrieved by RAG correspond to documents annotated as gold evidence in FEVER. We calculate the overlap in article titles between the topkdocuments retrieved by RAG and gold evidence annotations. We ﬁnd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article in 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases. 4.5 Additional Results Generation Diversity Section 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and speciﬁc than BART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding [33, 59, 39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to total ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence’s generations are more diverse than RAG-Token’s, and both are signiﬁcantly more diverse than BART without needing any diversity-promoting decoding. Retrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task. To assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever during training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks. We compare RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [53]. Here, we replace RAG’s retriever with a ﬁxed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating p(z|x). Table 6 shows the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are heavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval improves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial. Index hot-swapping An advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge can be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to update their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [5] Wikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer index from our main results (December 2018). We prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed 7 Table 4: Human assessments for the Jeopardy Question Generation Task.

Effect of Retrieving more documents Models are trained with either 5 or 10 retrieved latent documents, and we do not observe signiﬁcant differences in performance between them.

Such tasks include open-domain question answering [5, 29], fact checking [ 56], fact completion [ 48], long-form question answering [ 12], Wikipedia article generation [36], dialogue [ 41, 65, 9, 13], translation [ 17], and language modeling [ 19, 27]. Our work uniﬁes previous successes in incorporating retrieval into individual tasks, showing that a single retrieval-based architecture is capable of achieving strong performance across several tasks. 8 General-Purpose Architectures for NLP Prior work on general-purpose architectures for NLP tasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval. A single, pre-trained language model has been shown to achieve strong performance on various classiﬁcation tasks in the GLUE bench-marks [60, 61] after ﬁne-tuning [49, 8]. GPT-2 [50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained language model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks. For further improvement, BART [32] and T5 [51, 52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder model that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative and generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uniﬁed architecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models. Learned Retrieval There is signiﬁcant work on learning to retrieve documents in information retrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [ 44, 26] similar to ours. Some work optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a speciﬁc, downstream task such as question answering, using search [46], reinforcement learning [6, 63, 62], or a latent variable approach [31, 20] as in our work. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to achieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture can be ﬁne-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks. Memory-based Architectures Our document index can be seen as a large external memory for neural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [64, 55]. Concurrent work [14] learns to retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our work. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over fact embeddings [15, 13].

A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather distributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of interpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s memory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive dialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF rather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9]. Retrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style approaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited to provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including Machine Translation [ 18, 22] and Semantic Parsing [21]. Our approach does have several differences, including less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several pieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents rather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and could represent promising future work. 6 Discussion In this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric memory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We found that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual and speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating its effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model without requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components can be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some another objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric memories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a wide variety of NLP tasks. 9 Broader Impact This work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more effective at their jobs. With these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be employed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [50] are valid here, although arguably to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in the news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing content [54].

Abstract The Kalman ﬁlter provides an effective solution to the linear-Gaussian ﬁl tering problem. How-ever, where there is nonlinearity, either in the model speciﬁcation or the observation process, other methods are required. We consider methods known generically as particle ﬁlters , which include the condensation algorithm and the Bayesian bootstrap or sampling importan ce resampling (SIR) ﬁlter. These ﬁlters represent the posterior distribution of the state variab les by a system of particles which evolves and adapts recursively as new information becomes available. In practi ce, large numbers of particles may be required to provide adequate approximations and for certain applications, after a sequence of updates, the particle system will often collapse to a single p oint. We introduce a method of monitoring the efﬁciency of these ﬁlters, which provides a simple quantitative assessment of sam-ple impoverishment and show how to construct improved particle ﬁlters which are both structurally efﬁcient, in terms of preventing the collapse of the particle system and co mputationally efﬁcient in their implementation. We illustrate with the classic bearings-only t racking problem. Keywords: Kalman ﬁlter, Condensation algorithm, Bayesian bootstrap ﬁlter, Sampli ng impor-tance resampling (SIR) ﬁlter, Sequential estimation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Impor-tance resampling. 1 Introduction The Bayesian approach to dynamic state estimation problems involves the construction of the probabil-ity density function (PDF) of the current state of an evolvin g system, given the accumulated observation history. For linear Gaussian models where the PDF can be summ arised by means and covariances, the calculation is carried out in terms of the familiar updating equations of the Kalman ﬁlter. In general, for nonlinear, non-Gaussian models, there is no simple way to pr oceed. Two difﬁculties must be resolved: how to represent a general PDF using ﬁnite computer storage a nd how to perform the integrations in-volved in updating the PDF when new data are acquired. Several approximate methods have been proposed. These incl ude the extended Kalman ﬁlter [1, 2], the Gaussian sum ﬁlter [3], approximating the ﬁrst two moments o f the PDF [4,5] and numerical integration over a grid of points in the state space [6–10] . However, none of these methods can be applied automati-cally. Typically, they have to be tuned to take account of fea tures of each speciﬁc problem. For example, in grid-based methods the number and location of the grid poi nts has to be decided upon, usually by a process of trial and error. Furthermore, updating the distr ibution of the state of the system as new data arrive usually entails a formidable computational overhea d. 1 There is now a substantial literature concerned with simula tion based ﬁlters in which the required PDF is represented by a scatter of particles which propagate throu gh the state space [9,11–19]. The propagation and adaptation rules are chosen so that the combined weight o f particles in a particular region will ap-proximate the integral of the PDF over the region.

Such ﬁlter s have been variously described as Bayesian bootstrap, condensation, Monte-Carlo and Metropolis-Has tings importance resampling ﬁlters. For the purposes of this paper we adopt the term Monte Carlo particle ﬁlter or particle ﬁlter for short. Gordon, Salmond and Smith [14] demonstrate the effectiveness of a si mple algorithm for particle evolution for various nonlinear ﬁltering applications. Their method has become known as the Sampling Importance Resampling (SIR) ﬁlter or, more commonly in the engineering literature, the Bayesian bootstrap ﬁlter. The standard SIR ﬁlter is vulnerable to sample impoverishment [17, 20–22], so that the particle distri-bution gives a poor approximation of the required PDF. In ext reme cases, after a sequence of updates the particle system can collapse to a single point. In less ex treme cases, although several particles may survive, there is so much internal correlation that summary statistics behave as if they are derived from a substantially smaller sample. To compensate, large numbe rs of particles are required in realistic prob-lems. In this paper we show how sample impoverishment can be quanti ﬁed. We introduce modiﬁcations which we demonstrate to have superior performance to the SIR ﬁlter both in terms of combating sample impoverishment and in computational cost. In section 2 we give a brief review of Bayesian ﬁltering theor y. In Section 3 we reformulate the SIR ﬁlter as an evolving random measure and show that variance reducti on techniques from the theory of Monte-Carlo integration [23] can be applied. Section 4 introduces the modiﬁed particle algorithm, and we note that the computational complexity of each update calculati on can be reduced from O /( N log N /) to O /( N /) where N is the number of particles. Section 5 demonstrates how to qua ntify sample impoverishment and Section 6 contains an application of the new algorithm to the classic bearings-only tracking problem. Finally Section 7 presents some conclusions. 2 Bayesian Filtering Following Gordon, Salmond and Smith [14] we represent the state vector at time k by x k /2 R n , which satisﬁes x k /+/1 /= f k /( x k /; w k /) where f k /: R n /\u0002 R m /! R n is the system transition function and w k is a noise term whose known distribution is independent of time.

It then introduces efficient particle filters as a refinement of the Sequential Importance Resampling (SIR) filter, suggesting that a larger number of samples should be taken from each stratum during the resampling stage to maintain the size of the support set. The text emphasizes the advantages of stratified sampling over simple random sampling for achieving greater accuracy.\n\nThe document outlines the mathematical formulation of the probability distributions involved and discusses the challenges of ensuring that the sample sizes are integers while maintaining small variances. It presents an algorithm that achieves this goal and mentions an alternative method that may lead to fluctuations in particle population size. Finally, it describes the initialization and preliminary steps of the proposed particle filter, which starts with a random measure approximating the desired probability density function."

See also Section 3.1 below. 3 Random measures Particle ﬁlters work by providing a Monte Carlo approximation to the PDF which can be easily updated to incorporate new information as it arrives. The Monte Carl o approximation to a PDF p /( x k /) at time k consists of a set of random nodes in the state space /( s i k /) i /=/1 /:/:/: N , termed the support , and a set of associated weights /( m i k /) i /=/1 /:/:/:N summing to 1.

We advocate the use of this diagnostic generally, in assessi ng the performance of Monte Carlo ﬁlters. The smaller the effective sample size is, the less reliable t he ﬁlter is. In principle, a Bayesian ﬁlter 8 should be assessed by looking at its performance averaged ov er the population of trajectories generated by the system model. However, for non-linear problems it may happen that most of the trajectories are simple to ﬁlter and only a few are ‘difﬁcult cases’. It is ther efore helpful to see how the ﬁlter performs for typical examples of these difﬁcult cases. An example of s uch a problem is given in Section 6. The integrated correlation time in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) calculations in non-dynamic problems [29] and the effective sample size play similar rol es. Neither of these diagnostics checks to see whether there is convergence to the right distribution.

Finally, they acknowledge the support received for their research and express gratitude to colleagues for their contributions.\nThe document discusses the variance properties of two estimators, indicating that the variance of one estimator is always smaller than that of another, particularly when the observation is not informative. It then introduces efficient particle filters as a refinement of the Sequential Importance Resampling (SIR) filter, suggesting that a larger number of samples should be taken from each stratum during the resampling stage to maintain the size of the support set. The text emphasizes the advantages of stratified sampling over simple random sampling for achieving greater accuracy.\n\nThe document outlines the mathematical formulation of the probability distributions involved and discusses the challenges of ensuring that the sample sizes are integers while maintaining small variances. It presents an algorithm that achieves this goal and mentions an alternative method that may lead to fluctuations in particle population size. Finally, it describes the initialization and preliminary steps of the proposed particle filter, which starts with a random measure approximating the desired probability density function.\nThe document discusses a method for approximating velocities using a midpoint approximation within the context of a leap-frog algorithm. It describes how velocities at a given step can be calculated and introduces an equivalent formulation of the algorithm. The initial state of an object and the variances of system noise and observation error are specified. The observations consist of a sequence of bearings, and the document references a prior distribution used in a study by Gordon, Salmond, and Smith. \n\nTo construct an importance probability density function (PDF), the document outlines a mathematical formulation that involves converting certain variables to polar coordinates. The importance PDF is derived by simplifying the expression, ultimately leading to a specific form that incorporates the relationship between the variables involved.

Key points include:\n\n1. **Elimination of Resampling Phase**: The update step of the SIR filter can be modified to eliminate the resampling phase, which is problem-specific and detailed in Section 6.\n\n2. **Computational Complexity**: The traditional method of sampling from a discrete distribution using binary search is inefficient, requiring O(N log N) calculations. A more efficient approach involves simulating exponentially distributed variables and merging running totals, reducing the complexity to O(N).\n\n3. **Stratified Sampling**: The document outlines an algorithm for precise proportional stratification, ensuring that the number of samples in each category closely matches the expected number, with deviations of no more than one.\n\n4. **Effective Sample Size**: The document introduces the concept of effective sample size as a diagnostic for sample impoverishment, which helps compare the accuracy of different particle filters in estimating properties of the state distribution.\n\nOverall, the content focuses on enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of particle filtering techniques in statistical estimation.\nThe document discusses grid-based methods and their limitations in updating system state distributions, particularly the computational overhead involved. It introduces simulation-based filters, specifically Monte Carlo particle filters, which represent the required probability density function (PDF) using a scatter of particles that propagate through the state space. The text highlights the effectiveness of the Sampling Importance Resampling (SIR) filter, developed by Gordon, Salmond, and Smith, but notes its vulnerability to sample impoverishment, where the particle distribution may poorly approximate the required PDF after updates.\n\nTo address this issue, the paper proposes modifications to the SIR filter that improve performance in combating sample impoverishment and reduce computational costs. It outlines the structure of the paper, which includes a review of Bayesian filtering theory, a reformulation of the SIR filter as an evolving random measure, the introduction of a modified particle algorithm, and a method for quantifying sample impoverishment.

Efficient estimation of population quantities can be achieved by sampling a fixed number from each stratum, with the Neyman allocation being the most efficient method.\n\n5. **Proportional Allocation**: In practice, proportional allocation is often used due to unknown variances or multiple functions being monitored, which can be more efficient than simple random sampling.\n\n6. **Resampling**: A random measure can be converted into an equally weighted measure through resampling, which involves sampling with replacement from the original random measure.\n\nOverall, the content emphasizes the importance of sampling strategies in estimating population characteristics effectively.\nThe document discusses a proposed particle filter method for estimating state distributions in a probabilistic framework.

Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved signiﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional computation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains. Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network. In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. 2 Background The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8]. 3 Model Architecture Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.

Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively. 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The ﬁrst is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-2 Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture. wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512. Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i. 3.2 Attention An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention We call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the 3 Scaled Dot-Product Attention  Multi-Head Attention Figure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel. query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values. In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices Kand V. We compute the matrix of outputs as: Attention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT √dk )V (1) The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1√dk\n\nPlease summarize the main points of the content.\nAnswer:",

We compute the matrix of outputs as: Attention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT √dk )V (1) The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk . 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the ﬁnal values, as depicted in Figure 2. Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this. 4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = ∑dk i=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk. 4 MultiHead(Q,K,V ) = Concat(head1,..., headh)WO where headi = Attention(QWQ i ,KW K i ,VW V i ) Where the projections are parameter matricesWQ i ∈Rdmodel×dk , WK i ∈Rdmodel×dk , WV i ∈Rdmodel×dv and WO ∈Rhdv×dmodel . In this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use dk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality. 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways: • In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [31, 2, 8]. • The encoder contains self-attention layers.

This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [31, 2, 8]. • The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder. • Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2. 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. FFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2) While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality dff = 2048. 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel. 3.5 Positional Encoding Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the 5 Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel size of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.

The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and ﬁxed [8]. In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies: PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel ) PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel ) where posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto 10000 ·2π. We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of PEpos. We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [8] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training. 4 Why Self-Attention In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), with xi,zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata. One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required. The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types. As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin 6 the input sequence centered around the respective output position.

In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin 6 the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work. A single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O(k·n·d+ n·d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model. As side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences. 5 Training This section describes the training regime for our models. 5.1 Training Data and Batching We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens. 5.2 Hardware and Schedule We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days). 5.3 Optimizer We used the Adam optimizer [17] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula: lrate= d−0.5 model ·min(step_num−0.5,step_num·warmup_steps−1.5) (3) This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_stepstraining steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup_steps= 4000. 5.4 Regularization We employ three types of regularization during training: Residual Dropout We apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized.

    "output": "The document discusses the concepts of Scaled Dot-Product Attention and Multi-Head Attention, which are key components of the Transformer model. Here are the main points:\n\n1. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: This mechanism computes attention by taking a set of queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V). The attention function is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V\n   \\]\n   The scaling factor \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_k}} \\) is used to prevent large dot products from pushing the softmax function into regions with small gradients.\n\n2. **Additive vs. Dot-Product Attention**: The document contrasts additive attention, which uses a feed-forward network for compatibility, with dot-product attention. While both have similar theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is faster and more space-efficient in practice, especially for larger dimensions.\n\n3. **Multi-Head Attention**: Instead of a single attention function, Multi-Head Attention projects queries, keys, and values multiple times (h times) using learned linear projections. Each head performs attention in parallel, allowing the model to capture information from different representation subspaces. The outputs from all heads are concatenated and projected to form the final output.\n\n4. **Applications in the Transformer Model**: Multi-Head Attention is utilized in three ways:\n   - **Encoder-Decoder Attention**: Queries come from the decoder, while keys and values come from the encoder, allowing the decoder to attend to all positions in the input sequence.\n   - **Self-Attention in the Encoder**: All keys, values, and queries originate from the same source, specifically the output of the previous layer in the encoder.\n\nOverall, these attention mechanisms enhance the model's ability to process and understand sequences by allowing it to focus on different parts of the input effectively."

For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained signiﬁcantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles. We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours. The code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor.

Key points include:\n\n1. **Computational Complexity**: Self-attention layers have a complexity of O(n²·d), while recurrent layers have O(n·d²) and convolutional layers have O(k·n·d²). Self-attention is faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length (n) is smaller than the representation dimensionality (d).\n\n2. **Parallelization**: Self-attention allows for constant time operations (O(1)) for all positions, while recurrent layers require O(n) sequential operations, making self-attention more efficient for learning long-range dependencies.\n\n3. **Path Length**: The maximum path length for self-attention is constant (O(1)), while for recurrent layers it is linear (O(n)). This shorter path length in self-attention facilitates learning long-range dependencies more effectively.\n\n4. **Positional Encodings**: The document describes the use of sine and cosine functions for positional encodings, which help the model learn relative positions and potentially generalize to longer sequences than those seen during training.\n\n5. **Future Work**: The authors mention plans to explore restricting self-attention to a neighborhood of size r to improve computational performance for very long sequences, which would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r).\n\nOverall, the document highlights the advantages of self-attention in terms of computational efficiency, parallelization, and the ability to learn long-range dependencies compared to recurrent and convolutional layers.\nThe document discusses the architecture and components of the Transformer model, focusing on the use of attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks. Here are the main points:\n\n1. **Multi-Head Attention**: The Transformer employs multi-head attention in three key ways:\n   - **Encoder-Decoder Attention**: Queries come from the decoder, while keys and values come from the encoder, allowing the decoder to attend to all input positions.\n   - **Self-Attention in Encoder**: All keys, values, and queries originate from the encoder's previous layer, enabling each position to attend to all previous positions.\n   - **Self-Attention in Decoder**: Similar to the encoder, but with a masking mechanism to prevent leftward information flow, preserving the auto-regressive property.\n\n2. **Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks (FFN)**: Each layer in the encoder and decoder includes a fully connected feed-forward network, consisting of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation. The input and output dimensions are 512, while the inner layer has a dimension of 2048.\n\n3. **Embeddings and Softmax**: The model uses learned embeddings to convert input and output tokens into vectors of dimension 512. It shares the weight matrix between the embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, scaling the weights by the square root of the model dimension.\n\n4. **Positional Encoding**: To incorporate the order of tokens in the sequence, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings. These encodings have the same dimension as the embeddings, allowing for their summation.\n\n5. **Complexity Analysis**: The document includes a table comparing the complexity per layer, maximum path lengths, and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types, highlighting the efficiency of self-attention compared to recurrent and convolutional layers.\n\nOverall, the document outlines the structural components and mechanisms that enable the Transformer model to effectively process sequences without relying on recurrence or convolution.\nThe document discusses the architecture of the Transformer model, which is designed for neural sequence transduction and follows an encoder-decoder structure. Here are the main points:\n\n1. **Model Structure**: The Transformer consists of an encoder that maps input sequences to continuous representations and a decoder that generates output sequences in an auto-regressive manner.\n\n2. **Encoder and Decoder**:\n   - The encoder has a stack of 6 identical layers, each containing a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a fully connected feed-forward network. Residual connections and layer normalization are applied to the outputs of each sub-layer.\n   - The decoder also has 6 identical layers but includes an additional sub-layer for multi-head attention over the encoder's output.

Key points include:\n\n1. **Learning Rate Schedule**: The learning rate is adjusted using a formula that increases linearly during the first 4000 warmup steps and decreases thereafter based on the inverse square root of the step number.\n\n2. **Regularization Techniques**: Three types of regularization are employed:\n   - **Residual Dropout**: Dropout is applied to the output of each sub-layer and to the sums of embeddings and positional encodings, with a dropout rate of 0.1 for the base model.\n   - **Label Smoothing**: A label smoothing value of 0.1 is used, which improves accuracy and BLEU scores despite increasing perplexity.\n\n3. **Performance Results**: The Transformer model achieves superior BLEU scores compared to previous state-of-the-art models on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, with the big model scoring 28.4 and 41.0 respectively. It also demonstrates significantly lower training costs.\n\n4. **Training Details**: The big model was trained for 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs, and the base model surpassed all previously published models at a fraction of the training cost. The training involved averaging the last 5 or 20 checkpoints for base and big models, respectively.\n\n5. **Inference Settings**: During inference, beam search with a beam size of 4 and a length penalty of 0.6 was used, with a maximum output length set to input length + 50.\n\nOverall, the Transformer model shows significant advancements in machine translation efficiency and effectiveness.\nThe document discusses the concepts of Scaled Dot-Product Attention and Multi-Head Attention, which are key components of the Transformer model. Here are the main points:\n\n1. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: This mechanism computes attention by taking a set of queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V). The attention function is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V\n   \\]\n   The scaling factor \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_k}} \\) is used to prevent large dot products from pushing the softmax function into regions with small gradients.\n\n2. **Additive vs. Dot-Product Attention**: The document contrasts additive attention, which uses a feed-forward network for compatibility, with dot-product attention. While both have similar theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is faster and more space-efficient in practice, especially for larger dimensions.\n\n3. **Multi-Head Attention**: Instead of a single attention function, Multi-Head Attention projects queries, keys, and values multiple times (h times) using learned linear projections. Each head performs attention in parallel, allowing the model to capture information from different representation subspaces. The outputs from all heads are concatenated and projected to form the final output.\n\n4. **Applications in the Transformer Model**: Multi-Head Attention is utilized in three ways:\n   - **Encoder-Decoder Attention**: Queries come from the decoder, while keys and values come from the encoder, allowing the decoder to attend to all positions in the input sequence.\n   - **Self-Attention in the Encoder**: All keys, values, and queries originate from the same source, specifically the output of the previous layer in the encoder.\n\nOverall, these attention mechanisms enhance the model's ability to process and understand sequences by allowing it to focus on different parts of the input effectively.\nThe document discusses the computational efficiency of self-attention layers compared to recurrent layers and convolutional layers in the context of machine translation models. Key points include:\n\n1. **Computational Complexity**: Self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length (n) is shorter than the representation dimensionality (d), which is common in sentence representations.\n\n2. **Long Sequences**: To enhance performance with long sequences, self-attention can be limited to a neighborhood around the output position, reducing the maximum path length to O(n/r).\n\n3. **Convolutional Layers**: A single convolutional layer does not connect all input-output pairs, requiring multiple layers for full connectivity. Separable convolutions reduce complexity significantly, but even at maximum kernel width, their complexity matches that of a self-attention layer combined with a feed-forward layer.\n\n4. **Interpretable Models**: Self-attention may lead to more interpretable models, with attention heads learning distinct tasks related to sentence structure.\n\n5. **Training Regime**: The models were trained on the WMT 2014 English-German and English-French datasets, with specific batching strategies based on sequence length.\n\n6. **Hardware and Training Schedule**: Training was conducted on 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs, with base models taking about 0.4 seconds per step over 100,000 steps, while larger models took 1.0 seconds per step over 300,000 steps.\n\n7. **Optimizer and Learning Rate**: The Adam optimizer was used with specific hyperparameters, and the learning rate was adjusted throughout training, increasing linearly during a warmup period and then decreasing based on the inverse square root of the step number.\n\n8. **Regularization Techniques**: The training employed residual dropout, applying dropout to the output of each sub-layer before normalization, as well as to the sums of embeddings.\n\nOverall, the document outlines the advantages of self-attention in terms of speed and interpretability, details the training process, and describes the hardware and optimization strategies used.\n\nPlease write a comprehensive summary of this..\nAnswer: ",

However, as the standard approach is to train the network to minimize a prediction loss, the resultant model remains ignorant to its prediction conﬁdence. Orthogonally to Bayesian neural nets that indirectly infer prediction uncertainty through weight uncertainties, we propose explicit modeling of the same using the theory of subjective logic. By placing a Dirichlet distribution on the class probabilities, we treat predictions of a neural net as subjective opinions and learn the function that collects the evidence leading to these opinions by a deterministic neural net from data. The resultant predictor for a multi-class classiﬁcation problem is another Dirichlet distribution whose parameters are set by the continuous output of a neural net. We provide a preliminary analysis on how the peculiarities of our new loss function drive improved uncertainty estimation. We observe that our method achieves unprecedented success on detection of out-of-distribution queries and endurance against adversarial perturbations. 1 Introduction The present decade has commenced with the deep learning approach shaking the machine learning world [20]. New-age deep neural net constructions have exhibited amazing success on nearly all applications of machine learning thanks to recent inventions such as dropout [30], batch normalization [13], and skip connections [11]. Further ramiﬁcations that adapt neural nets to particular applications have brought unprecedented prediction accuracies, which in certain cases exceed human-level performance [ 5, 4]. While one side of the coin is a boost of interest and investment on deep learning research, the other is an emergent need for its robustness, sample efﬁciency, security, and interpretability. On setups where abundant labeled data are available, the capability to achieve sufﬁciently high accuracy by following a short list of rules of thumb has been taken for granted. The major challenges of the upcoming era, hence, are likely to lie elsewhere rather than test set accuracy improvement. For instance, is the neural net able to identify data points belonging to an unrelated data distribution? Can it simply say \"I do not know\" if we feed in a cat picture after training the net on a set of handwritten digits? Even more critically, can the net protect its users against adversarial attacks? These questions have been addressed by a stream of research on Bayesian Neural Nets (BNNs) [ 8, 18, 26], which estimate prediction uncertainty by approximating the moments of the posterior predictive distribution. 32nd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2018), Montréal, Canada. This holistic approach seeks for a solution with a wide set of practical uses besides uncertainty estimation, such as automated model selection and enhanced immunity to overﬁtting. In this paper, we put our full focus on the uncertainty estimation problem and approach it from a Theory of Evidence perspective [7, 14]. We interpret softmax, the standard output of a classiﬁcation network, as the parameter set of a categorical distribution. By replacing this parameter set with the parameters of a Dirichlet density, we represent the predictions of the learner as a distribution over possible softmax outputs, rather than the point estimate of a softmax output. In other words, this density can intuitively be understood as a factory of these point estimates.

    "output": "The document discusses the evaluation of a model's uncertainty estimation and its impact on prediction accuracy. Key points include:\n\n1. **Uncertainty and Model Capacity**: The model's capacity is not reduced by uncertainty estimation. Predictions with maximum uncertainty (u=1.0) are treated as failures in overall accuracy calculations, indicating the model's refusal to make a prediction.\n\n2. **Impact of Uncertainty Threshold**: A figure illustrates that as the uncertainty threshold decreases, the accuracy of predictions with lower uncertainty increases, eventually reaching 1.0.\n\n3. **Quantifying Uncertainty**: The authors use a specific equation to quantify uncertainty, contrasting it with other methods that use entropy to measure prediction uncertainty.\n\n4. **Dataset Evaluations**: The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and tested on the notMNIST dataset, which contains letters instead of digits, leading to high entropy predictions.

In a set of experiments, we demonstrate that this technique outperforms state-of-the-art BNNs by a large margin on two applications where high-quality uncertainty modeling is of critical importance. Speciﬁcally, the predictive distribution of our model approaches the maximum entropy setting much closer than BNNs when fed with an input coming from a distribution different from that of the training samples. Figure 1 illustrates how sensibly our method reacts to the rotation of the input digits. As it is not trained to handle rotational invariance, it sharply reduces classiﬁcation probabilities and increases the prediction uncertainty after circa 50◦input rotation. The standard softmax keeps reporting high conﬁdence for incorrect classes for high rotations. Lastly, we observe that our model is clearly more robust to adversarial attacks on two different benchmark data sets. All vectors in this paper are column vectors and are represented in bold face such as x where the k-th element is denoted as xk. We use ⊙to refer to the Hadamard (element-wise) product. 2 Deﬁciencies of Modeling Class Probabilities with Softmax The gold standard for deep neural nets is to use the softmax operator to convert the continuous activations of the output layer to class probabilities. The eventual model can be interpreted as a multinomial distribution whose parameters, hence discrete class probabilities, are determined by neural net outputs. For a K−class classiﬁcation problem, the likelihood function for an observed tuple (x,y) is Pr(y|x,θ) = Mult(y|σ(f1(x,θ)),··· ,σ(fK(x,θ))), where Mult(···) is a multinomial mass function, fj(x,θ) is the jth output channel of an arbitrary neural net f(·) parametrized by θ, and σ(uj) = euj /∑K i=1 euK is the softmax function. While the continuous neural net is responsible for adjusting the ratio of class probabilities, softmax squashes these ratios into a simplex. The eventual softmax-squashed multinomial likelihood is then maximized with respect to the neural net parameters θ. The equivalent problem of minimizing the negative log-likelihood is preferred for computational convenience −log p(y|x,θ) = −log σ(fy(x,θ)) which is widely known as the cross-entropy loss. It is noteworthy that the probabilistic interpretation of the cross-entropy loss is mere Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). As being a frequentist technique, MLE is not capable of inferring the predictive distribution variance. Softmax is also notorious with inﬂating the probability of the predicted class as a result of the exponent employed on the neural net outputs. The consequence is then unreliable uncertainty estimations, as the distance of the predicted label of a newly seen observation is not useful for the conclusion besides its comparative value against other classes.\n\nPlease summarize the main points of the content.\nAnswer:",

Results show that Dropout achieves the highest accuracy but is overconfident in its predictions, while EDL (Ensemble Deep Learning) strikes a balance between accuracy and uncertainty, associating high uncertainty with incorrect predictions.\n\n3. **CIFAR5 Dataset**: Similar experiments are conducted on the CIFAR5 dataset, reinforcing the finding that EDL associates higher uncertainty with wrong predictions compared to other models, which tend to be overconfident.\n\n4. **Uncertainty Modeling**: The document also reviews related work in uncertainty-aware predictors, highlighting Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs).

Inspired from [9] and [24], on the left side of Figure 1, we demonstrate how the LeNet [ 22] fails to classify an image of digit 1 from MNIST dataset when it is continuously rotated in the counter-clockwise direction. Commonly to many standardized architectures, LeNet estimates classiﬁcation probabilities with the softmax function. As the image is rotated it fails to classify the image correctly; the image is classiﬁed as 2 or 5 based on the degree of rotation. For instance, for small degrees of rotation, the image is correctly classiﬁed as 1 with high probability values. However, when the image is rotated between 60 −100 degrees, it is classiﬁed as 2. The network starts to classify the image as 5 when it is rotated between 110 −130 degrees. While the classiﬁcation probability computed using the softmax function is quite high for the misclassiﬁed samples (see Figure 1, left panel), our approach proposed in this paper can accurately quantify uncertainty of its predictions (see Figure 1, right panel). 2 Rotation Angle Rotation Angle Figure 1: Classiﬁcation of the rotated digit 1 (at bottom) at different angles between 0 and 180 degrees. Left: The classiﬁcation probability is calculated using the softmax function. Right: The classiﬁcation probability and uncertainty are calculated using the proposed method. 3 Uncertainty and the Theory of Evidence The Dempster–Shafer Theory of Evidence (DST) is a generalization of the Bayesian theory to subjective probabilities [7]. It assigns belief masses to subsets of a frame of discernment, which denotes the set of exclusive possible states, e.g., possible class labels for a sample. A belief mass can be assigned to any subset of the frame, including the whole frame itself, which represents the belief that the truth can be any of the possible states, e.g., any class label is equally likely. In other words, by assigning all belief masses to the whole frame, one expresses ’I do not know’as an opinion for the truth over possible states [ 14]. Subjective Logic (SL) formalizes DST’s notion of belief assignments over a frame of discernment as a Dirichlet Distribution [14]. Hence, it allows one to use the principles of evidential theory to quantify belief masses and uncertainty through a well-deﬁned theoretical framework. More speciﬁcally, SL considers a frame of Kmutually exclusive singletons (e.g., class labels) by providing a belief mass bk for each singleton k= 1,...,K and providing an overall uncertainty mass of u. These K+ 1 mass values are all non-negative and sum up to one, i.e., u+ K∑ k=1 bk = 1, where u≥0 and bk ≥0 for k= 1,...,K .

A belief mass bk for a singleton kis computed using the evidence for the singleton. Let ek ≥0 be the evidence derived for the kth singleton, then the belief bk and the uncertainty uare computed as bk = ek S and u= K S, (1) where S = ∑K i=1(ei + 1). Note that the uncertainty is inversely proportional to the total evidence. When there is no evidence, the belief for each singleton is zero and the uncertainty is one. Differently from the Bayesian modeling nomenclature, we term evidence as a measure of the amount of support collected from data in favor of a sample to be classiﬁed into a certain class. A belief mass assignment, i.e., subjective opinion, corresponds to a Dirichlet distribution with parameters αk = ek + 1. That is, a subjective opinion can be derived easily from the parameters of the corresponding Dirichlet distribution using bk = (αk −1)/S, where S = ∑K i=1 αi is referred to as the Dirichlet strength. The output of a standard neural network classiﬁer is a probability assignment over the possible classes for each sample. However, a Dirichlet distribution parametrized over evidence represents the density of each such probability assignment; hence it models second-order probabilities and uncertainty [14]. The Dirichlet distribution is a probability density function (pdf) for possible values of the probability mass function (pmf) p. It is characterized by Kparameters α = [α1,··· ,αK] and is given by D(p|α) = { 1 B(α) ∏K i=1 pαi−1 i for p ∈SK, 0 otherwise, 3 where SK is the K-dimensional unit simplex, SK = { p ⏐⏐⏐∑K i=1 pi = 1 and 0 ≤p1,...,p K ≤1 } and B(α) is the K-dimensional multinomial beta function [19]. Let us assume that we have b = ⟨0,..., 0⟩as belief mass assignment for a 10-class classiﬁcation problem. Then, the prior distribution for the classiﬁcation of the image becomes a uniform distribution, i.e., D(p|⟨1,..., 1⟩) — a Dirichlet distribution whose parameters are all ones. There is no observed evidence, since the belief masses are all zero. This means that the opinion corresponds to the uniform distribution, does not contain any information, and implies total uncertainty, i.e.,u= 1. Let the belief masses become b = ⟨0.8,0,..., 0⟩after some training. This means that the total belief in the opinion is 0.8 and remaining 0.2 is the uncertainty.

In this case, the opinion would correspond to the Dirichlet distribution D(p|⟨41,1,..., 1⟩). Given an opinion, the expected probability for the kth singleton is the mean of the corresponding Dirichlet distribution and computed as ˆpk = αk S . (2) When an observation about a sample relates it to one of the Kattributes, the corresponding Dirichlet parameter is incremented to update the Dirichlet distribution with the new observation. For instance, detection of a speciﬁc pattern on an image may contribute to its classiﬁcation into a speciﬁc class. In this case, the Dirichlet parameter corresponding to this class should be incremented. This implies that the parameters of a Dirichlet distribution for the classiﬁcation of a sample may account for the evidence for each class. In this paper, we argue that a neural network is capable of forming opinions for classiﬁcation tasks as Dirichlet distributions. Let us assume that αi = ⟨αi1,...,α iK⟩is the parameters of a Dirichlet distribution for the classiﬁcation of a sample i, then (αij −1) is the total evidence estimated by the network for the assignment of the sample ito the jth class. Furthermore, given these parameters, the epistemic uncertainty of the classiﬁcation can easily be computed using Equation 1. 4 Learning to Form Opinions The softmax function provides a point estimate for the class probabilities of a sample and does not provide the associated uncertainty. On the other hand, multinomial opinions or equivalently Dirichlet distributions can be used to model a probability distribution for the class probabilities. Therefore, in this paper, we design and train neural networks to form their multinomial opinions for the classiﬁcation of a given sample ias a Dirichlet distribution D(pi|αi), where pi is a simplex representing class assignment probabilities. Our neural networks for classiﬁcation are very similar to classical neural networks. The only difference is that the softmax layer is replaced with an activation layer, e.g., ReLU, to ascertain non-negative output, which is taken as the evidence vector for the predicted Dirichlet distribution. Given a sample i, let f(xi|Θ) represent the evidence vector predicted by the network for the classiﬁcation, where Θ is network parameters. Then, the corresponding Dirichlet distribution has parameters αi = f(xi|Θ) + 1. Once the parameters of this distribution is calculated, its mean, i.e., αi/Si, can be taken as an estimate of the class probabilities. Let yi be a one-hot vector encoding the ground-truth class of observationxi with yij = 1 and yik = 0 for all k̸= j, and αi be the parameters of the Dirichlet density on the predictors.

Then, the corresponding Dirichlet distribution has parameters αi = f(xi|Θ) + 1. Once the parameters of this distribution is calculated, its mean, i.e., αi/Si, can be taken as an estimate of the class probabilities. Let yi be a one-hot vector encoding the ground-truth class of observationxi with yij = 1 and yik = 0 for all k̸= j, and αi be the parameters of the Dirichlet density on the predictors. First, we can treat D(pi|αi) as a prior on the likelihood Mult(yi|pi) and obtain the negated logarithm of the marginal likelihood by integrating out the class probabilities Li(Θ) = −log (∫ K∏ j=1 pyij ij 1 B(αi) K∏ j=1 pαij−1 ij dpi ) = K∑ j=1 yij ( log(Si) −log(αij) ) (3) and minimize with respect to the αi parameters. This technique is well-known as the Type II Maximum Likelihood. 4 Alternatively, we can deﬁne a loss function and compute its Bayes risk with respect to the class predictor. Note that while the above loss in Equation 3 corresponds to the Bayes classiﬁer in the PAC-learning nomenclature, ones we will present below are Gibbs classiﬁers.

By decomposing the ﬁrst and second moments, the loss aims to achieve the joint goals of minimiz-ing the prediction error and the variance of the Dirichlet experiment generated by the neural net speciﬁcally for each sample in the training set. While doing so, it prioritizes data ﬁt over variance estimation, as ensured by the proposition below. Proposition 1. For any αij ≥1, the inequality Lvar ij <Lerr ij is satisﬁed. The next step towards capturing the behavior of Equation 5 is to investigate whether it has a tendency to ﬁt to the data. We assure this property thanks to our next proposition. Proposition 2. For a given sample iwith the correct label j, Lerr i decreases when new evidence is added to αij and increases when evidence is removed fromαij. A good data ﬁt can be achieved by generating arbitrarily many evidences for all classes as long as the ground-truth class is assigned the majority of them. However, in order to perform proper uncertainty modeling, the model also needs to learn variances that reﬂect the nature of the observations. Therefore, it should generate more evidence when it is more sure of the outcome. In return, it should avoid generating evidences at all for observations it cannot explain. Our next proposition provides a guarantee for this preferable behavior pattern, which is known in the uncertainty modeling literature as learned loss attenuation [16]. Proposition 3. For a given sample i with the correct class label j, Lerr i decreases when some evidence is removed from the biggest Dirichlet parameterαil such that l̸= j. 5 When put together, the above propositions indicate that the neural nets with the loss function in Equation 5 are optimized to generate more evidence for the correct class labels for each sample and helps neural nets to avoid misclassiﬁcation by removing excessive misleading evidence. The loss also tends to shrink the variance of its predictions on the training set by increasing evidence, but only when the generated evidence leads to a better data ﬁt. The proofs of all propositions are presented in the appendix. The loss over a batch of training samples can be computed by summing the loss for each sample in the batch. During training, the model may discover patterns in the data and generate evidence for speciﬁc class labels based on these patterns to minimize the overall loss. For instance, the model may discover that the existence of a large circular pattern on MNIST images may lead to evidence for the digit zero. This means that the output for the digit zero, i.e., the evidence for class label 0, should be increased when such a pattern is observed by the network on a sample.

Unfortunately, when the number of counter-examples is limited, decreasing the magnitude of the generated evidence may increase the overall loss, even though it decreases the loss for the counter-examples. As a result, the neural network may generate some evidence for the incorrect labels. Such misleading evidence for a sample may not be a problem as long as it is correctly classiﬁed by the network, i.e., the evidence for the correct class label is higher than the evidence for other class labels. However, we prefer the total evidence to shrink to zero for a sample if it cannot be correctly classiﬁed. Let us note that a Dirichlet distribution with zero total evidence, i.e., S = K, corresponds to the uniform distribution and indicates total uncertainty, i.e., u = 1. We achieve this by incorporating a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term into our loss function that regularizes our predictive distribution by penalizing those divergences from the \"I do not know\" state that do not contribute to data ﬁt. The loss with this regularizing term reads L(Θ) = N∑ i=1 Li(Θ) + λt N∑ i=1 KL[D(pi|˜αi) ||D(pi|⟨1,..., 1⟩)], where λt = min(1.0,t/10) ∈[0,1] is the annealing coefﬁcient, tis the index of the current training epoch, D(pi|⟨1,..., 1⟩) is the uniform Dirichlet distribution, and lastly ˜αi = yi + (1 −yi) ⊙αi is the Dirichlet parameters after removal of the non-misleading evidence from predicted parameters αi for sample i.

We also compare their performance using adversarial examples generated using the Fast Gradient Sign method [10]. 5.1 Predictive Uncertainty Performance We trained the LeNet architecture for MNIST using 20 and 50 ﬁlters with size 5 ×5 at the ﬁrst and second convolutional layers, and 500 hidden units for the fully connected layer. Other methods are also trained using the same architecture with the priors and posteriors described in [ 24].

To be fair, we use the same metric for the evaluation of prediction uncertainty in the rest of the paper; we use Equation 2 for class probabilities. In our ﬁrst set of evaluations, we train the models on the MNIST train split using the same LeNet architecture and test on the notMNIST dataset, which contains letters, not digits. Hence, we expect predictions with maximum entropy (i.e. uncertainty). On the left panel of Figure 3, we show the empirical CDFs over the range of possible entropies [0,log(10)] for all models trained with MNIST dataset. The curves closer to the bottom right corner of the plot are desirable, which indicate maximum entropy in all predictions [24]. It is clear that the uncertainty estimates of our model is signiﬁcantly better than those of the baseline methods.

A major branch along this line is Gaussian Processes (GPs) [29], which are powerful in both making accurate predictions and providing reliable measures for the uncertainty of their predictions. Their power in prediction has been demonstrated in different contexts such as transfer learning [15] and deep learning [32]. The value of their uncertainty calculation has set the state of the art in active learning [12]. As GPs are non-parametric models, they do not have a notion of deterministic or stochastic model parameters. A signiﬁcant advantage of GPs in uncertainty modeling is that the variance of their predictions can be calculated in closed form, although they are capable of ﬁtting a wide spectrum of non-linear prediction functions to data. Hence they are universal predictors [31]. Another line of research in prediction uncertainty modeling is to employ prior distributions on model parameters (when the models are parametric), infer the posterior distribution, and account for uncertainty using high-order moments of the resultant posterior predictive distribution. BNNs also fall into this category [25]. BNNs build on accounting for parameter uncertainty by applying a prior distribution on synaptic connection weights. Due to the non-linear activations between consecutive layers, calculation of the resultant posterior on the weights is intractable. Improvement of the approximation techniques, such as Variational Bayes (VB) [ 2, 6, 27, 23, 9] and Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SG-HMC) [ 3] tailored speciﬁcally for scalable inference of BNNs is an active research ﬁeld.

Orthogonal to this approach, we bypass inferring sources of uncertainty on the predictor and directly model a Dirichlet posterior by learning its hyperparameters from data via a deterministic neural net. 7 Conclusions In this work, we design a predictive distribution for classiﬁcation by placing a Dirichlet distribution on the class probabilities and assigning neural network outputs to its parameters. We ﬁt this predictive distribution to data by minimizing the Bayes risk with respect to the L2-Norm loss which is regularized by an information-theoretic complexity term. The resultant predictor is a Dirichlet distribution on class probabilities, which provides a more detailed uncertainty model than the point estimate of the standard softmax-output deep nets. We interpret the behavior of this predictor from an evidential reasoning perspective by building the link from its predictions to the belief mass and uncertainty decomposition of the subjective logic. Our predictor improves the state of the art signiﬁcantly in two uncertainty modeling benchmarks: i) detection of out-of-distribution queries, and ii) endurance against adversarial perturbations. 9 Acknowledgments This research was sponsored by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the U.K. Ministry of Defence under Agreement Number W911NF-16-3-0001.

    "input": "Human: This is a set of summary:\nThe document discusses the evaluation of a model's uncertainty estimation and its impact on prediction accuracy. Key points include:\n\n1. **Uncertainty and Model Capacity**: The model's capacity is not reduced by uncertainty estimation. Predictions with maximum uncertainty (u=1.0) are treated as failures in overall accuracy calculations, indicating the model's refusal to make a prediction.\n\n2. **Impact of Uncertainty Threshold**: A figure illustrates that as the uncertainty threshold decreases, the accuracy of predictions with lower uncertainty increases, eventually reaching 1.0.\n\n3. **Quantifying Uncertainty**: The authors use a specific equation to quantify uncertainty, contrasting it with other methods that use entropy to measure prediction uncertainty.\n\n4. **Dataset Evaluations**: The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and tested on the notMNIST dataset, which contains letters instead of digits, leading to high entropy predictions. Empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) show that the model's uncertainty estimates outperform baseline methods.\n\n5. **CIFAR10 Experiment**: The model is also evaluated using a subset of classes from the CIFAR10 dataset, with results indicating that the model provides more accurate predictions as uncertainty decreases.\n\n6. **Adversarial Examples**: The model's performance is tested against adversarial examples generated using the Fast Gradient Sign method. The results show that the model associates higher uncertainty with its predictions compared to other methods, particularly as adversarial perturbation increases.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes the effectiveness of the proposed model in quantifying uncertainty and maintaining accuracy across different datasets and conditions.\nThe document discusses the evaluation of a machine learning approach in terms of accuracy and uncertainty when dealing with adversarial examples. Key points include:\n\n1. **Adversarial Examples**: The study uses the Fast Gradient Sign method to generate adversarial examples for models trained on the MNIST dataset, with varying levels of perturbation (ϵ). \n\n2. **Model Performance**: The Deep Ensemble model is excluded from certain experiments for fairness, as it is specifically trained on adversarial examples. Results show that Dropout achieves the highest accuracy but is overconfident in its predictions, while EDL (Ensemble Deep Learning) strikes a balance between accuracy and uncertainty, associating high uncertainty with incorrect predictions.\n\n3. **CIFAR5 Dataset**: Similar experiments are conducted on the CIFAR5 dataset, reinforcing the finding that EDL associates higher uncertainty with wrong predictions compared to other models, which tend to be overconfident.\n\n4. **Uncertainty Modeling**: The document also reviews related work in uncertainty-aware predictors, highlighting Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). GPs are noted for their ability to provide reliable uncertainty measures and accurate predictions, while BNNs account for parameter uncertainty through prior distributions, though they face challenges in calculating posterior distributions in closed form.\n\n5. **Research Directions**: The text mentions ongoing research in improving approximation techniques for scalable inference in BNNs, indicating a vibrant field focused on enhancing uncertainty modeling in machine learning.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes the importance of balancing accuracy and uncertainty in machine learning models, particularly in the context of adversarial examples.\nThe document discusses the limitations of traditional neural network classification methods, particularly focusing on the use of the softmax function and the cross-entropy loss for estimating class probabilities. Key points include:\n\n1. **Cross-Entropy Loss**: The negative log-likelihood, or cross-entropy loss, is preferred for computational convenience in neural networks. However, it is based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), which does not provide information about the variance of predictive distributions.\n\n2. **Softmax Limitations**: The softmax function can inflate the predicted probabilities of classes, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimations. This is particularly evident when classifying images that are rotated, as demonstrated with the LeNet architecture on the MNIST dataset.\n\n3. **Classification Example**: The document illustrates how LeNet misclassifies a rotated digit '1' as it rotates, showing high confidence in incorrect classifications (e.g., classifying as '2' or '5' at certain angles).\n\n4. **Proposed Method**: The authors propose a new method that can accurately quantify uncertainty in predictions, contrasting it with the softmax approach.\n\n5. **Dempster–Shafer Theory of Evidence (DST)**: The document introduces DST as a framework for assigning belief masses to possible states (class labels), allowing for a more nuanced representation of uncertainty. \n\n6. **Subjective Logic (SL)**: SL formalizes DST's belief assignments using a Dirichlet Distribution, enabling the quantification of belief masses and uncertainty in a structured manner.\n\n7. **Belief Masses**: The framework allows for the assignment of belief masses to singletons (class labels) and an overall uncertainty mass, ensuring that all values are non-negative and sum to one.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes the need for improved methods to quantify uncertainty in neural network predictions, moving beyond traditional softmax-based approaches.\nThe document discusses a novel approach to quantifying classification uncertainty in neural networks, proposed by Murat Sensoy, Lance Kaplan, and Melih Kandemir. Here are the main points:\n\n1. **Limitations of Deterministic Neural Networks**: Traditional deterministic neural networks effectively predict outcomes but do not provide information about their prediction confidence.\n\n2. **Proposed Method**: The authors suggest an explicit modeling of prediction uncertainty using the theory of subjective logic. They place a Dirichlet distribution on class probabilities, treating the predictions as subjective opinions.\n\n3. **Learning Process**: A deterministic neural network is used to learn the function that collects evidence leading to these opinions, resulting in a multi-class classification predictor represented by a Dirichlet distribution.\n\n4. **Loss Function**: The new loss function is designed to improve uncertainty estimation, leading to better performance in detecting out-of-distribution queries and resilience against adversarial attacks.\n\n5. **Context of Deep Learning**: The paper highlights the advancements in deep learning and the need for robustness, sample efficiency, security, and interpretability, especially in scenarios with abundant labeled data.\n\n6. **Comparison with Bayesian Neural Networks**: While Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) estimate prediction uncertainty through weight uncertainties, this approach focuses solely on uncertainty estimation from a Theory of Evidence perspective.\n\n7. **Softmax Output Interpretation**: The authors reinterpret the softmax output of classification networks as parameters of a categorical distribution, replacing it with parameters of a Dirichlet density to represent predictions as a distribution over possible outputs.\n\nOverall, the paper emphasizes the importance of uncertainty estimation in neural networks and presents a new method that enhances this capability while addressing challenges in machine learning applications.\nThe document discusses a loss function designed for neural networks that aims to balance prediction accuracy and variance in a Dirichlet experiment context. Key points include:\n\n1. **Loss Function Structure**: The loss function is decomposed into two components: one that minimizes prediction error (Lerr) and another that accounts for variance (Lvar). This structure allows for a clear interpretation of how the loss function operates.\n\n2. **Proposition 1**: It establishes that for any Dirichlet parameter (αij) greater than or equal to 1, the variance loss (Lvar) is always less than the error loss (Lerr), indicating a prioritization of data fit over variance estimation.\n\n3. **Proposition 2**: It states that the error loss decreases when new evidence is added to the correct class label and increases when evidence is removed, suggesting that the model can improve its fit by accumulating evidence for the correct class.\n\n4. **Proposition 3**: This proposition guarantees that the error loss decreases when evidence is removed from the largest Dirichlet parameter that does not correspond to the correct class, promoting the model's ability to avoid misclassification.\n\n5. **Evidence Generation**: The loss function encourages the model to generate more evidence for the correct class labels while minimizing misleading evidence, thus enhancing classification accuracy.\n\n6. **Training Dynamics**: During training, the model learns to identify patterns in the data and adjust evidence accordingly, improving its predictions based on observed patterns while reducing evidence for incorrect classifications.\n\nOverall, the loss function is designed to optimize neural networks for better data fitting and uncertainty modeling by effectively managing evidence generation for class labels.\nThe document discusses a training approach for neural networks that focuses on improving data fit by generating evidence for specific class labels based on patterns in the data. Key points include:\n\n1. **Loss Calculation**: The loss for a batch of training samples is computed by summing individual sample losses. The model aims to minimize overall loss by discovering patterns that correlate with class labels.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**: The model may identify specific patterns (e.g., a large circular shape) that suggest certain class labels (e.g., the digit zero). When such patterns are observed, the evidence for the corresponding class label is increased.\n\n3. **Counter-Examples**: When counter-examples (e.g., a digit six with a similar pattern) are encountered, the model adjusts its parameters through backpropagation to reduce evidence for incorrect labels. However, limited counter-examples can lead to misleading evidence for incorrect labels.\n\n4. **Evidence Management**: The document emphasizes the importance of reducing total evidence to zero for samples that cannot be correctly classified. A Dirichlet distribution with zero total evidence indicates total uncertainty.\n\n5. **KL Divergence Regularization**: To manage evidence and uncertainty, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term is added to the loss function. This term penalizes deviations from a uniform distribution, promoting a state of uncertainty when the model is unsure about a classification.\n\n6. **Annealing Coefficient**: The effect of the KL divergence is gradually increased using an annealing coefficient, allowing the model to explore the parameter space and avoid premature convergence to a uniform distribution for misclassified samples.\n\n7. **Experimental Evaluation**: The method is evaluated through experiments designed for comparability with previous studies.\n\nOverall, the approach aims to enhance the model's ability to classify samples accurately while managing uncertainty and misleading evidence effectively.\nThe document discusses the use of a Dirichlet Distribution within a framework of evidential theory to quantify belief masses and uncertainty in classification tasks. Key points include:\n\n1. **Belief Mass Assignment**: The framework involves K mutually exclusive singletons (class labels), each assigned a belief mass \\( b_k \\) and an overall uncertainty mass \\( u \\). These values are non-negative and sum to one.\n\n2. **Evidence and Belief Calculation**: The belief mass \\( b_k \\) for a singleton is derived from evidence \\( e_k \\) related to that singleton. The equations \\( b_k = \\frac{e_k}{S} \\) and \\( u = \\frac{K}{S} \\) are used, where \\( S = \\sum_{i=1}^{K}(e_i + 1) \\).\n\n3. **Uncertainty**: Uncertainty is inversely proportional to total evidence. If no evidence is present, belief masses are zero, and uncertainty is one.\n\n4. **Dirichlet Distribution**: The belief mass assignment corresponds to a Dirichlet distribution with parameters \\( \\alpha_k = e_k + 1 \\). The subjective opinion can be derived from this distribution, modeling second-order probabilities and uncertainty.\n\n5. **Example of Classification**: In a 10-class classification scenario, if the initial belief mass is \\( b = \\langle 0, \\ldots, 0 \\rangle \\), the prior distribution is uniform, indicating total uncertainty. After training, if the belief mass changes to \\( b = \\langle 0.8, 0, \\ldots, 0 \\rangle \\), it reflects a total belief of 0.8 and an uncertainty of 0.2, with the Dirichlet strength calculated as \\( S = 50 \\).\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes the relationship between evidence, belief masses, and uncertainty in the context of classification using Dirichlet distributions.\nThe document discusses a novel approach to uncertainty estimation in classification tasks using a Theory of Evidence perspective. Key points include:\n\n1. **Holistic Approach**: The method aims to provide practical applications beyond uncertainty estimation, such as automated model selection and improved resistance to overfitting.\n\n2. **Softmax Interpretation**: The standard softmax output of classification networks is interpreted as the parameters of a categorical distribution. The authors propose replacing these parameters with those of a Dirichlet density, allowing predictions to be represented as a distribution over possible softmax outputs rather than a single point estimate.\n\n3. **Loss Function and Backpropagation**: The model employs a specific loss function that is minimized using standard backpropagation techniques.\n\n4. **Performance Improvement**: Experiments show that this approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) in applications requiring high-quality uncertainty modeling.\n\n5. **Predictive Distribution**: The model's predictive distribution is closer to the maximum entropy setting compared to BNNs, especially when inputs differ from training samples. It demonstrates a sensible response to input rotations, reducing classification probabilities and increasing uncertainty after significant rotations, unlike standard softmax.\n\n6. **Robustness to Adversarial Attacks**: The proposed model exhibits greater robustness against adversarial attacks across different benchmark datasets.\n\n7. **Limitations of Softmax**: The document critiques the softmax operator for its limitations in modeling class probabilities, particularly its tendency to inflate predicted class probabilities and provide unreliable uncertainty estimations. The cross-entropy loss, derived from softmax, is identified as a frequentist technique that does not account for predictive distribution variance.\n\nOverall, the paper emphasizes the advantages of using a Dirichlet density for uncertainty estimation in classification tasks, highlighting its improved performance and robustness compared to traditional methods.\nThe document discusses the use of Dirichlet distributions to model opinions in classification tasks performed by neural networks. Here are the main points:\n\n1. **Dirichlet Distribution**: The initial belief is represented by a Dirichlet distribution with parameters all set to one, indicating total uncertainty (uniform distribution). As training progresses, belief masses are updated (e.g., from zero to values like ⟨0.8, 0, ..., 0⟩), reflecting increased confidence in certain classes.\n\n2. **Dirichlet Strength and Evidence**: The Dirichlet strength is calculated based on the uncertainty, and new evidence is derived from the updated belief masses. For example, if the total belief in a class is 0.8, the strength is computed, and the amount of new evidence for that class is derived.\n\n3. **Updating Parameters**: When new observations are made (e.g., detecting patterns in images), the corresponding Dirichlet parameters are incremented to reflect this new evidence, allowing the model to account for evidence for each class.\n\n4. **Neural Networks and Opinions**: The paper argues that neural networks can form opinions for classification tasks as Dirichlet distributions. The parameters of the Dirichlet distribution are linked to the evidence estimated by the network for class assignments.\n\n5. **Softmax vs. Dirichlet**: Traditional softmax functions provide point estimates for class probabilities without uncertainty. In contrast, using Dirichlet distributions allows for modeling the probability distribution of class probabilities, incorporating uncertainty.\n\n6. **Network Architecture**: The neural network architecture is similar to classical networks, but the softmax layer is replaced with a non-negative activation layer (like ReLU) to produce an evidence vector for the Dirichlet distribution.\n\n7. **Mean as Class Probability Estimate**: The mean of the Dirichlet distribution (αi/S) is used as an estimate for class probabilities, and the ground-truth class is encoded using a one-hot vector.\n\n8. **Prior and Likelihood**: The Dirichlet distribution is treated as a prior on the likelihood of the observed class, leading to the computation of the negated logarithm of the marginal likelihood.\n\nOverall, the document presents a framework for using Dirichlet distributions in neural networks to enhance classification tasks by incorporating uncertainty and evidence into the decision-making process.\nThe document discusses advancements in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and their approach to modeling uncertainty in predictions. Key points include:\n\n1. **Parameter Uncertainty**: BNNs address uncertainty by applying prior distributions to synaptic connection weights, but calculating the posterior distribution is challenging due to non-linear activations.\n\n2. **Approximation Techniques**: Research is ongoing to improve approximation methods like Variational Bayes and Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for scalable inference in BNNs.\n\n3. **Posterior Predictive Distribution**: The posterior predictive distributions of BNNs cannot be computed in closed form, and current methods rely on Monte Carlo integration, which introduces noise in uncertainty estimates.\n\n4. **Proposed Method**: The authors propose a new predictive distribution for classification that uses a Dirichlet distribution for class probabilities, with parameters derived from neural network outputs. This method aims to minimize Bayes risk with an L2-Norm loss, regularized by an information-theoretic complexity term.\n\n5. **Uncertainty Modeling**: The resulting Dirichlet distribution provides a more nuanced uncertainty model compared to standard softmax outputs, enhancing the understanding of belief mass and uncertainty decomposition.\n\n6. **Performance Improvement**: The proposed predictor shows significant improvements in two benchmarks: detecting out-of-distribution queries and resisting adversarial perturbations.\n\n7. **Acknowledgments**: The research was supported by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the U.K. Ministry of Defence, with a disclaimer regarding the views expressed in the document.\n\nOverall, the work emphasizes a novel approach to uncertainty modeling in neural networks, enhancing predictive performance and robustness.\nThe document discusses a method for estimating class probabilities using a Dirichlet distribution in the context of classification tasks. Here are the main points:\n\n1. **Evidence Vector and Dirichlet Distribution**: For a given sample \\(i\\), the evidence vector \\(f(x_i|\\Theta)\\) predicted by a neural network is used to define the parameters \\(\\alpha_i\\) of a Dirichlet distribution, where \\(\\alpha_i = f(x_i|\\Theta) + 1\\).\n\n2. **Class Probability Estimation**: The mean of the Dirichlet distribution, \\(\\alpha_i/S_i\\), serves as an estimate for the class probabilities.\n\n3. **Loss Functions**: The document presents different approaches to define a loss function based on the marginal likelihood and Bayes risk:\n   - The first approach uses the negated logarithm of the marginal likelihood, leading to a loss function that corresponds to the Type II Maximum Likelihood.\n   - The second approach defines a cross-entropy loss, resulting in a loss function involving the digamma function.\n   - The third approach, which is preferred based on empirical findings, uses a sum of squares loss.\n\n4. **Preferred Loss Function**: The sum of squares loss is favored because it provides a more stable performance and avoids generating excessively high belief masses for classes. It is expressed in a form that separates the error term \\(L_{\\text{err}}^{ij}\\) and a variance term \\(L_{\\text{var}}^{ij}\\).\n\n5. **Theoretical Properties**: The preferred loss function has advantageous theoretical properties, including an easily interpretable form that incorporates both the expected value and variance of the predicted probabilities.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes the importance of selecting an appropriate loss function for classification tasks and presents a rationale for choosing the sum of squares loss based on empirical observations.\nThe document discusses a method for uncertainty estimation in neural networks, particularly focusing on a proposed approach called EDL (Expected Distribution Learning).
